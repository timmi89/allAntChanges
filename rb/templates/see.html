    <h1>Ever wonder, "What are they thinking?"</h1>
    <div class="grid-7 s-grid-whole">
      <p>We think an online audience has some pretty interesting parallels with live audiences.  When you go listen to a band, or a speaker, or see a play &#8212; there’s not a whole lot of feedback from the audience during the show.  Often, the performer (as well as members of their audience) wish there was more &#8212; so long as it's unobtrusive.</p>
      <p>Take an author speaking on book tour.  After she concludes her speech, a small number of exceptionally brave or passionate people ask questions in front of the audience. Then, maybe a handful stick around to discuss the talk, and ask more questions of the author.  These are like your online commenters.</p>
      <blockquote>"But what about everyone else who just... left?"</blockquote>
      <p>"What about everyone else who did not have time to stick around?  Did they like my talk?  What did they like?  What surprised them?  Did they laugh at my story?  What did they agree with?  What did they learn from?"</p>
      <p>How can she really find out?</p>

      <p>Online audiences are very similar.  As we read or watch or listen, something strikes us.  We want someone to know what we thought about <em>that thing right there</em>.  And it needs to be easy -- for us to say, and for others to hear and make sense of.</p>
      <p>ReadrBoard is built to address this very real problem.  Whether it’s a recipe, an academic talk, a breakdown of last night’s football game, photos from a fashion show, or a new music video, we want it to be simple, meaningful, and measurable for people to give a little input.</p>
      <p>If it's simple, people will do it.

    <div class="grid-half s-grid-whole">
      <p>Out of the box, your readers can simply roll their mouse over an image, video, audio embed, or text to start reacting with ReadrBoard.</p>
      <p>You can make it even easier.  You can allow any HTML element on the page to be the call-to-action for <strong>any</strong> piece of content.</p>
      <p><strong>You can even customize the reactions for each piece of content.</strong></p>
      <p>All it takes are a few custom HTML attributes.  This means your CMS can easily power these custom implementations.</p>

      <p>There is a major movement towards web annotation right now.</p>
      <p>There is a <a href="http://www.openannotation.org/" target="_blank">maturing specification</a> for it.  Medium, Quartz, and RapGenius have popularized it.  LiveFyre launched their own annotation tool this year, which has been installed on a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/livefyre-sidenotes/" target="_blank">few hundred sites</a>.</p>
      <p>We think it's all just a bit too much work.  For you, and your readers.  Check out an excerpt from <a href="https://medium.com/human-parts/coming-out-as-biracial-c25d6ae8f2af" target="_blank">this (fantastic) piece</a> at Medium.</p>
      <img src="/static/images/medium-work.png" />
      <p>The inline comments are great.  But there are 25 of them!  If each comment is 10 words, your reader has to comb through another 250 words to see what the community thinks. And that's more for you to moderate.</p>
      <p>Even worse? In-line comments can go off-topic, too.</p>
      <p>Compare that to this excerpt from <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3027786/your-5-minute-guide-to-ux-from-squarespace-and-mailchimp" target="_blank">this Fast Company Labs piece</a> using ReadrBoard.
      <img src="/static/images/fastco-grid.png" class="vspace" />
      <p>There are <strong>22 reactions</strong>, yet in an instant, you understand the community's range of sentiment.</p>
      <p>And each reaction is to the content.  Not someone else's content.</p>
      <p>Don't get us wrong. We're not anti-comment, we just think comments aren't always needed to understand the main reason someone cares about something. As you see in that Fast Company article, some of the reactions do have inline comments.  ReadrBoard lets people elaborate on their reaction with a comment, and we show those comments by adding a comment icon next to a reaction.</p>
      <p>This means your readers easily skip the discussions they're not interested in.  Don't care about the comment someone left after reacting <strong>Duh</strong>?  No problem.  Just click on the comments by the <strong>Clever</strong>, and read those instead.</p>
      <p>We see reactions more than 100x as much as inline comments on our platform, so we think it's striking a chord with our communities.</p>
