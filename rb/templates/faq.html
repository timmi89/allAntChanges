			<li>
				<strong>What is ReadrBoard?</strong>
				<p>ReadrBoard is the fastest way to say exactly what you think about any phrase, picture, video, or article on the web.</p>
				<p>So, if a certain phrase, picture, or video on a page grabs your attention for some reason -- just select it, and you can say what you think.  You can also cast a reaction on a whole page.</p>
				<p>To use ReadrBoard, a website adds it to their pages, and you can use it.  Nothing is installed onto your computer.  Every website will offer a few reactions you can simply click on, as shown on the image to the right, or you can type in your own.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Do I have to register to use ReadrBoard?</strong>
				<p>You can react, comment, and share on a website using ReadrBoard five times before we require you to register.  We think you should try something out before you're asked to tell us about yourself.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Why must I log in with Facebook to use ReadrBoard?</strong>
				<p>We used Facebook Connect because it's easy, and because we think that reactions and comments are higher in quality when people are forthcoming about who they are.  There is a time and place for anonymity, and we're working on a solution to that -- but most of time, we think, it's good to know who is saying something.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>What else can I do with ReadrBoard?</strong>
				<p>You can also bookmark content that is interesting to you.  Your bookmarks are private to you, and available on your ReadrBoard profile.  Every time you bookmark something, you tag it, so it's easy to search and sort your bookmarks later.</p>
				<p>And, ReadrBoard.com will soon be a great way to find content online that people are really reacting to -- you'll see what content is interesting to people, and why they found it interesting (because it's funny, or controversial, or interesting, or heartwarming, or... you get the idea).  You'll soon be able to follow other ReadrBoard users, to stay on top of whatever content they are reacting to online.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Are my reactions and comments in ReadrBoard visible to others?</strong>
				<p>By default, your profile is publicly visible, so others can see what you are reacting to.  But, you can make your profile completely private.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Why do websites use ReadrBoard?</strong>
				<p>Website owners want to know what you really think about their content, and want readers -- who have a common interest, their content! -- to be able to interact with each other and learn from each other.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>How is ReadrBoard different than clicking the Facebook Like button?</strong>
				<p>ReadrBoard is very different than the Like button (or Google's +1 button, or tweeting, and so on).  It is different in these ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Reacting with ReadrBoard <strong>does not tell Facebook anything</strong> -- we don't send any data about your reactions and comments to Facebook. React all you want!</li>
					<li>ReadrBoard does not post to your Facebook wall, unless you explicitly use our integrated sharing feature.</li>
					<li>ReadrBoard lets you react to just part of a page.  Do you "like" something in an article, but don't want to say you like the whole thing?  ReadrBoard lets you do just that.</li>
					<li>Sometimes, you don't "like" content, but you do have something to say.  ReadrBoard makes it super simple and fast to express yourself.</li>
					<li>People reading the same page you are reading can see you reactions on that page, and you can see theirs.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>How is ReadrBoard different than commenting?</strong>
				<p>Reacting with ReadrBoard is much faster than typing out a whole comment, but ReadrBoard also lets you leave comments!  ReadrBoard comments are different than comments you are used to.  Here's how:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>ReadrBoard lets you leave a comment next to the content on a page you are reacting to, rather than at the bottom of the page.</li>
					<li>ReadrBoard comments are <strong>sorted by reaction</strong>. So when reading others' comments, you can just read the ones that interest you, because you know why the person commented before you read their comment.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>If I use ReadrBoard on a website, does that website get my email address or other personal information?</strong>
				<p>No.  We don't share your information with other websites, except for rare occasions where we specifically ask you and you specifically give permission.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>If I log in to ReadrBoard, am I also logging into the website I'm on while using ReadrBoard?</strong>
				<p>No.  If you log in to ReadrBoard, you are not also logging into any other site or service.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Is ReadrBoard part of Facebook?</strong>
				<p>No.  We use Facebook to authenticate who you are, but we have no formal relationship with them.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Does ReadrBoard ever post to my Facebook wall?</strong>
				<p>Only if you explicitly share to Facebook.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Does ReadrBoard post to any other social media services (Twitter, Tumblr, etc)?</strong>
				<p>No.  Your reactions, bookmarks, and comments do not get posted to 3rd party social networks, unless you specifically share something on them.  React as much as you want!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Does ReadrBoard ever share my information with third parties?</strong>
				<p>Your privacy and information are very important to us.  We don't share personally identifiable information about you with any other site, company, or organization, unless we have specifically asked you to share with a certain party, and you gave permission.  Simply using ReadrBoard to react, share, and comment does <strong>not</strong> give us permission to share information about you.</p>
				<p>Your profile at ReadrBoard.com does have your name, and picture from Facebook, on it.  If you do not want these to be visible to the outside world, you can simply set your profile to be private.</p>
				<p>We do plan, in the future, to use information about readers in aggregate to help suggest content, advertisements, ReadrBoard users, and ReadrBoard sites based on content you've interacted with.  We will probably use some third party services to do this.  We will <strong>never</strong> give them your personally identifiable information without specific permission from you.  Think of it like this:  ReadrBoard won't tell a third party that "Porter Bayne likes chili and interacts a lot on content about politics and football, give us an article suggestion for Porter."  Rather, our system would say, "We think this is a reader who likes chili, and interacts with content about politics and football.  What might this person like?"</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Does ReadrBoard use my information to target ads?</strong>
				<p>Not yet, but we think we will in the future, without giving your personally-identifying information out to third parties without your explicit permission.  See the answer to the above question for more details.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Does ReadrBoard use my information to target content?</strong>
				<p>Not yet, but we think we will in the future, without giving your personally-identifying information out to third parties without your explicit permission.  See the answer two questions up for more details.</p>
