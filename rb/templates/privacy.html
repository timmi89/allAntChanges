To register, You must either connect to the Widget through Facebook (see below for information on this process), in which case we collect information from Facebook about You, including Your profile picture, gender, networks, friends, education and other information that You make generally available on Facebook, or, You can create an account by providing Your email address and a password directly to us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Most of this Personal Information will be used by us to better provide the Services to You, but Your name and profile picture may be used in Your online profile that we make available on our Site, and on Publisher Sites (Your &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Profile</span><span class="c2">&rdquo;). Your Profile will also contain all of the information You provide through the Widget on a Publisher Site, such as Your votes, rating and comments (&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Profile Information</span><span class="c2">&rdquo;). When You comment through the Services about content on a Publisher Site, this information is associated with Your Profile and thus made available through the Widget and on the Site as being associated with both You and the Publisher Site. Your Profile Information may also contain a list of Antenna users who &ldquo;follow&rdquo; You or who You &ldquo;follow&rdquo;. To follow another Antenna user, You simply make a request on that End User&rsquo;s Profile page.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As Your Profile Information is intended by You to be made publicly available, Your Profile Information will not be considered Personal Information under this Privacy Statement, even though it contains Personal Information. &nbsp;We may use and disclose the Profile Information on the Site and through the Services in connection with Your Profile.

Many consider the use of Cookies to be industry standard, and our Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. &nbsp;Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Your Internet browser help file directions. &nbsp;If You choose to disable Cookies, You may experience session errors and may need to log-in again each time You use the Services.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Disclosure &ndash; Usage of Third Party Cookies</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We may use third party tracking services to track and analyze Anonymous Information from End Users of our Site and Services.

We will work with the SN Site&rsquo;s application protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows You to authorize us to access Your account on that SN Site on Your behalf. &nbsp;In order to provide this authorization, You will not provide us with Your user name or password to the SN Site, but You will need to log-in to that SN Site directly through our Site or Widget. &nbsp;Once authorized by You, the SN Site will provide us a token that allows the SN Site to recognize us when we ask, on Your behalf, for access to Your account information or to post information. You will be able to revoke our access to any SN Site at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within Your account settings on the applicable SN Site, though such revocation may limit the Services we are able to provide You.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Antenna will never post information to third party SN Sites without Your authorization.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">Use of Information</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3">Personal and Profile Information</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We will use Your Personal Information to:</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2">&middot;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Administer Your Account;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2">&middot;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Provide You and other Publishers and End Users with Services and customer support;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2">&middot;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Respond to Your requests, resolve disputes and/or troubleshoot problems;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2">&middot;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Verify Your compliance with Your obligations in our Terms of Service or other policies;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2">&middot;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Improve the quality of the Site and the Services; and</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2">&middot;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Communicate with You about the Site and the Services.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If You are an End User, we will also use Your Personal Information to:</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2">&middot;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Contact You about (through an opt-out email newsletter, or through our Site and Widget) or recommend specific content from Publishers based on Your prior Antenna activity, including if similar End Users enjoyed that content or if Your friends or connections commented on the same content You rated or commented on; and</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2">&middot;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Market our products and services (and those of third parties) to You that we believe may be of interest to You, including through the serving of personalized advertisements, though we will not disclose Your Personal Information in doing so. For example, we allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of End Users who will see their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected (including information You do not make available on the Site) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. For example, if You tend to view and comment on automobile-related content, we might use that interest to show You ads for automobiles (and to tell ad networks to serve those ads), but we do not tell any automobile maker who You are to display the advertisement, though the dealer or manufacturer may learn that You possess certain characteristics based on the fact that You received the advertisement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Whether You are an End User or Publisher, we may use Your Personal Information to create Anonymous Information by excluding information that makes the information personally identifiable to You.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We may send You communications via email about the Site and Services.
