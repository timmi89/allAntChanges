																					<div class="delicious-extended">
																						Oh yeah–they fauxpologized.–AJP "Nivea must have a serious lack of diversity on their marketing team, because there is no other explanation for why an ad like this got approved. The ad (see full image here) features a preppy, groomed black man holding the head of his former self, who's sporting a beard, an afro, and a pissed-off expression. The words 'Re-civilize Yourself' are scrawled across the image, with the smaller phrase 'Look like you give a damn' on top. The message couldn't be clearer: natural hair on a black man isn't a style preference or a nod to afrocentrism—it's straight-up uncivilized."

																						"Her biggest break was, of course, Avedon, the man who declared her 'probably the most beautiful woman in the world.' They were friends and collaborators “from 1958 until the day he died,” in 2004. But the Machado that Avedon met had come to fashion sideways. She claims that until she was employed as one, she didn’t know what a model was and had never read a fashion magazine. She’d been raised with two brothers and a stepbrother in a culture in which girls like her were invisible. White American women—Irene Dunne, Vivien Leigh, Rita Hayworth, and Machado’s idol, Ava Gardner—were the paragons of beauty in movies and posters around Shanghai. 'We [nonwhites] had no images. We had nothing that told us we were nice-­looking. Nothing. So I didn’t think of myself as good-looking at all. It never occurred to me,' she says. In other words, she’d never seen another China Machado."

																					<div class="delicious-extended">
																						" [I fell into a] group of six or so girls who had known each other through Chinese school and other various gatherings. I was the tallest, the widest and the most non-stereotypical 'Tiny Little Asian Girl.'

																						<p>"This came to their attention very quickly and was pointed out at every opportunity. To me, it seemed like every time one of them felt they were lacking an aspect of being small, fragile, graceful and adorable, they could point out that I was far less. Five plus years later, I still wonder why I put myself through that shattering of self-esteem. The worst of it came when one of the girls flat out told me to my face, “You are not like us, you are not Asian”. It seemed from that moment onwards, I have fought even harder to become one of them. Tiny, skinny, porcelain-faced, jet-black straight hair. This wound festered to the point of attempting to starve myself. Making myself miserable to please those who used me to boost their own self-esteem."</p>

																						"'There’s more than one cool now for black people,' Mr. Gumbs said on a recent Tuesday at the Bergen Street studio, wearing a slight wisp of a goatee and dark glasses that sharpened his round face. 'When we were growing up, it was just one kind of cool.'<br>
																						That was hip-hop, with its hegemonic style. But the men of Street Etiquette and their peers practice a deliberate elision of hip-hop style (except in the site’s early days, when the two were still shaking free of their Air Jordans). They even eschew the prim eccentricity of an Andre 3000, or the cosmopolitan flamboyance of Kanye West."

																				<strong>NewU Diversity in Media Start Up Camp!</strong>
																			</center>

																			<p>We are looking for talented media entrepreneurs to participate in a start-up camp and pitch slam! The benefit: Four people will walk away with $10,000 for their idea – and did I mention, it’s going to be in Vegas? The catch: You have to be a member of one of the UNITY organizations.(But there’s still time to pitch and join!)</p>

																			<blockquote>
																				<p><em>The New U: News Entrepreneurs Working Through UNITY</em> is a competitive program for journalists of color who want to become entrepreneurs. It supports and helps grow the creative ideas of participants through a national “startup camp”. In addition to offering a unique formula based in training and one-on-one mentoring, the program includes a competition for start-up funding to assist media entrepreneurs in realizing their ideas.</p>

																				<p>Since its inception in 2010, <a href="http://unityjournalists.org/newu2010">a total of 16 fellows</a>, members of AAJA, NABJ, NAHJ and NAJA, have learned about entrepreneurship and had an opportunity to pitch their ideas to a carefully-selected group of mentors, panelists and guest financial experts. In fall 2010, the participants’ video pitches were voted on by their industry peers, and 4 of the 16 participants– one from each of UNITY’s alliance partner organizations – each won $5,000 in seed money to further their entrepreneurial ideas.</p>

																				<p>In 2011, The New U project will offer one group training start-up camp for 20 selected fellows in Las Vegas that will convene October 17-19 of 2011. New U’s leadership team and returning mentors remain committed to its mission of increasing the number of innovative thinkers and product developers who are of color, providing them with a forum in which to develop and express innovative ideas. Participants’ travel expenses are covered through the grant, as is the cost of the program, and award grants for 2011 will increase to $10,000 per winner, of which there will be four.</p>

																				<p><a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&amp;pli=1&amp;formkey=dHVzNVFOYmJOOXhkSzBYeU1xU25sa1E6MA#gid=0">Go here to review application process and apply for the 2011 New U Fellowship</a>.</p>
																			</blockquote>

																			<p>Deadline is <strong>NEXT WEEK: August 26th.</strong> So apply. Even if you just have an idea, looking at the form will help you flesh it out – and it may be a stronger idea than you think!</p>

																			<p>Also, some disclosures: Doug is a good friend of mine, and I am also participating in this camp as a presenter. (The panel I will present to the fellows has a working title of “Things I Wish I Had Known Before Trying to Launch a Business.”)</p>

																				<p><strong>Elected Officials and Women’s Advocacy Organizations Hold Press Conference In Support Of Nafissatou Diallo</strong></p>

																				<p><em>Request Continuation of Manhattan Criminal Case; Demand Public Scrutiny of Victim Cease</em></p>

																				<p>New York, NY— On May 14, 2011, former IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn was arrested and charged with the sexual assault of 32-year-old Nafissatou Diallo, a Guinean housekeeper at the Sofitel New York Hotel in New York City.</p>

																				<p>By May 19, Mr. Strauss-Kahn was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury on seven criminal counts, two of which are first-degree criminal sexual acts. His bail was set at $1M, with additional 24-hour home detention and an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet. After Mr. Strauss-Kahn turned over his passport and posted an additional $5M bail bond, he was placed under house arrest in Manhattan. On July 1, a special hearing was called in which Manhattan District Attorney prosecutors cited credibility issues in regards to Ms. Diallo’s background, and released Ms. Strauss-Kahn on his own recognizance. He was arraigned on June 6, and pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.</p>

																				<p>As these events have unfolded, media outlets have used alleged sources from the Manhattan DA’s office to imply that the criminal case against Mr. Strauss-Kahn was unstable. These same alleged sources have been used to paint Ms. Diallo as a prostitute and a con artist, as well as accuse her of lying in her application for asylum in the United States, and for describing a false gang rape in Guinea.</p>

																				<p>Following Ms. Diallo’s accusations against Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a French writer also filed rape charges accusing Mr. Strauss-Kahn. In fact, the writer’s mother, who previously had a consensual relationship with Mr. Strauss-Kahn, described him as “a predator who isn’t looking to please, but to take.” A French newspaper later published claims that Mr. Strauss-Kahn harassed female flight attendants of Air France to such a degree that the airline instituted a policy of placing male attendants on his flights.</p>

																				<p>Public scrutiny of women who accuse men of rape is itself a manifestation of misogyny. In this particular case, the fact that the accused is wealthy, politically connected, and white; while the accuser is poor, non-white, and immigrant suggests that there are other social factors at play. The public “leaking” of confidential information regarding the criminal case (if these alleged sources are legitimate) directly interferes with the ongoing criminal case, and is unfair to all involved.</p>

																				<p>GOALS– Urge the Manhattan DA to look at the facts of the case, as well as the Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s history of conduct. Cease leaking of information pertaining to the case. Take into STRONG consideration Ms. Diallo’s medical report which includes testimony consistent with what the accuser told police, and which lists the cause of injuries as “rape”.</p>

																				<p>On August 16, medical reports which are consistent with Ms. Diallo’s testimony to police, and which lists the cause of injury as “rape”, were leaked. Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s attorneys allege that the report is “misleading and deceitful”.</p>

																				<p><strong>WHEN: August 18, 2011</strong></p>

																				<p>5:00PM- 7:00PM<br>
																				<strong><br>
																				WHERE: the steps of City Hall</strong></p>

																			<p>Welcome back to the Black panel on Interracial Dating. Our panelists are:</p>

																			<p><strong>N’Jaila Rhee</strong>, the mastermind behind <a href="http://blasianbytch.com/">BlaysianBytch.com</a> (link NSFW); <strong>Damon Young</strong>, better known as The Champ and one of two <a href="http://www.verysmartbrothas.com/">VerySmartBrothas</a>; <strong>Ashley</strong> – longtime reader and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/tallsoychai">friend of the blog</a>; <strong>Cheryl Lynn</strong>, <a href="http://www.digitalfemme.com/journal/">Digital Femme extraordinare,</a> rabblerouser, and longtime friend of the blog; <strong>Andrea Plaid</strong> – our own <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/andreaplaid">Sexual Correspondent</a>; <strong>Dani</strong> – long time friend of the blog; <strong>Sewere</strong> – long time commenter, <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2008/07/09/interracial-dating-a-nigerian-perspective/">one time contributor</a>, and friend of the blog; <strong>Tami Winfrey Harris</strong>, long time contributor and editor of <a href="http://loveisntenough.com/">Love Isn’t Enough</a> and <a href="http://www.whattamisaid.com/">What Tami Said</a>; <strong>Kadian Pow</strong>, friend of the blog and <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2011/08/10/an-american-in-birmingham-my-perspective-on-the-london-riots/">occasional contributor</a>, and <strong>Helena Andrews</strong>, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bitch-New-Black-Helena-Andrews/dp/0061778826"><em>Bitch is the New Black</em>.</a></p>

																			<center>
																				<strong>If you have dated interracially, did you have any fears or misgivings going into the situation? Did you peers react to you differently?</strong>
																			</center>

																			<p><strong>N’jaila:</strong> I’ve dated mostly Asian and Asian American men, which apparently makes me a freak of nature. Even my Asian and Indian girlfriends have made me feel like there was something wrong with me for dating Asian. Black women and Asian men are not supposed to date and my mom didn’t get the memo and passed on her strange mutation to me. There are times I feel especially alienated when my friends or coworkers ask the race of one of my dates and laugh at me when I say “Asian”.</p>

																			<p>There is a fear that I’m too Black and too Asian to be anything than an exotic romp. Black women’s sexualities’ are either way over amplified or completely disregarded. Mammy or Jezebel, either situation leaves me out of the dating pool for many men.</p>

																			<p>I think for me its also more complicated because I work in the adult industry. A lot of people assume that I’m dating a non-Black man because no Black man in his right mind would want to “turn a ho into a housewife”. I think sometimes you can get so wrapped up in how you assume or fear a man will see you that it ends a relationship before it can begin.</p>

																			<p><strong>Cheryl Lynn:</strong> I date interracially, but I often forget when I am. My friends and family don’t make it an issue at all. The neighborhoods I reside in don’t make it an issue. The only time it was an issue was when I dated someone who passed for white. We accidentally stumbled through an Italian festival in NYC and a white woman looked at me, rolled her eyes , and loudly asked “Why’d he bring her here?” We got the hell out of there pretty fast. I went to a rib joint with the same guy and got a few weird looks from a group of black guys. When I started speaking to my date, one of the dudes actually said “Oh, it’s okay. He’s Puerto Rican!” Seeing some of the nonsense that my friends who are in black/white couples have had to deal with makes me a bit wary of dating white men. I actually told a friend that I couldn’t be bothered with dating interracially after seeing the trouble she went through. My friend laughed and said, “You are in an interracial relationship right now!” I’d completely forgotten! He wasn’t white.</p>

																			<p><strong>Andrea:</strong> I’d be lying if I said no. In quite a few of my past IR relationships, especially with White men, I was “their first time” or some validation of how “not White” (meaning “not boring/status quo/racist”) they are. It’s gotten to the point were I simply ask if this is their first time dating interracially, especially dating a Black woman. This lets me know what I’m getting into or am up against. In my current relationship, I’m dating a White man who I met at an interracial-dating site. In his profile he said (and I quote): “ I’ve dated a number of, and have always been most attracted to, black women–so interracial dating is not a try-out or a new experience for me.” Which heartened me. We’re still working out some stickier points about race and racism in our relationship, where I have to do some gentle anti-racism conversations around humor, for example–but we’re getting along so far.</p>

																			<p>As for my peers… ::shrug:: They pretty much know how I roll as far as dating and mating. Quite a few of them have dated/mated interracially or are doing so now, so they just look at me. I think they’re more amazed I’m into polyamory and burlesque than into interracial dating.</p>

																			<p><strong>Helena:</strong> I went to winter formal with a Korean guy and I went to prom with the quarterback who was Filipino. I asked him because I’d had the hugest crush on him for more than a year. My aunts and cousins came over to house before prom to help me get dressed (we call this a “champagne party” in Cali) and they weren’t at all shocked that my date was Asian. They were impressed that he rolled up in a Beemer.</p>

																			<p>But once I got to college it seemed as if dating outside your race was much more taboo. I mean you couldn’t even kick it with other folks without being seen as a fake. I was used to eating kalbi and calling my Chinese best friend’s mom Auntie Diana, so the self-segregation in college threw me for a loop. It got so bad–me hanging with white people–that a friend, who’d eventually pledge a black sorority with me, pulled me aside to tell me that word on campus was that I “wasn’t black.” Like, huh?</p>

																			<p>Then sophomore year I actually dated a white guy for a hot week. We joked about race all the time. I think it made us feel mature and so over it. Once he asked me if I’d like to be the roast beef in his white bread sandwich. Seriously. We held hands and ate at a campus cafe together maybe two times and the streets started talking. One of my older guy friends, who my mother asked to look out for me, pulled me aside and told me that it wasn’t cool for me to date the white dude. We broke up, eventually. Because he played air guitar and it was college not because folks had a problem with it. But I still remember thinking that black men had a problem with seeing me with this white man. That was in 2000.</p>

																			<p><strong>Tami:</strong> I dated white and Asian men casually and also had a yearlong relationship with a white guy. Like Andrea, I’ve had the experience of navigating relationships with men who have never dated black women–sometimes wading through stereotypes and exoticizing. I also connected with some really good guys. None of them ever met my parents. That wasn’t by design, though.</p>

																			<p>Ultimately, the greater barrier in my longest IR relationship was class and not race. He was raised in and continued to identify with white, ethnic, working-class Chicago. I grew up the child of degreed black professionals in a suburban environment. Our outlooks and our goals were too far apart, no matter how much we liked each other. But, as someone mentioned above, I’m not sure class would have been as much a barrier, if we had race in common. That feels strange to say.</p>

																			<p><strong>Sewere:</strong> My general concern around interracial dating has always been having the patience to deal with a privileged partner. I realize the older I get the less willing I am to go through racism 101 with a partner, to explain to someone why I don’t want to be around racist family, why I wouldn’t want my kids around racist family members. I’m not even sure I have the patience to break down the deeper level racism or intersectional stuff, just because I think I expect that someone who wants to have a relationship with a person of color, should have already done some heavy lifting. More important, this doesn’t just apply to white folks, it applies to people of color as well, i.e. I expect that a Nigerian should be aware of intersecting discrimination and privileges vis-à-vis other folks of color.</p>

																			<p>The funny thing is I expect the same of African-American folks regarding approaching the diversity of Africa and Africans. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve had to break down attitudes influenced by colonial racism (starting with the Africa as a country misconception). I know this might seem like an unrealistic level of expectations, but honestly, I think people should be capable of treating others as full humans. If I get the impression the person I’m dating isn’t willing to understand how privilege works and isn’t willing to challenge herself or be challenged, then I end it.</p>

																			<p><strong>Dani:</strong> I can’t say I’ve really had fears. When I’ve been with someone who’s not black, I’ve been living in places where I have a kind of anonymity. It’s not like I’m in my hometown and people who’ve known me my whole life are offering their opinions of my dating choices. More importantly, my family and longtime friends know that being open to people of different races is part of who I’ve always been. It’s how I was raised. When I took a boyfriend who is Latino but kind of racially ambiguous home to meet my family, I remember one of my cousins asking, “What is he? Mexican?” But it was out of genuine curiosity. It wasn’t like some veiled slur. But I have to admit, one of the many reasons I have a lot of pride in my family is that we’re a strong *black* family. I struggle with what, if anything, this phrase means as some of my cousins and I partner with non-black people. And it makes me parse the phrase and think hard about the ways in which the “strong” and the “black” have been connected in my mind all these years. <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2011/08/19/on-interracial-dating-the-black-panel-2-of-4/#more-17072" class="more-link"></a></p>

																			</center>Welcome to the Asian panel on Interracial Dating. We actually did end up doing a South Asian panelist breakout, which will go next Thursday. Our panelists are:

																			<p><strong>N’Jaila Rhee</strong>, the mastermind behind <a href="http://blasianbytch.com/">BlaysianBytch.com</a> (link NSFW); <strong>Elton</strong>, long time commenter and friend of the blog; <strong>refresh_daemon</strong>, <a href="http://init-music.blogspot.com/2011/08/why-2ne1-matters.html">blogger</a> and <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2011/08/16/feminism-and-k-pop-why-2ne1-matters/">occasional contributor</a>; <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chrysaora">Christina Xu</a>, friend of the blog and <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2011/03/22/my-god-it%E2%80%99s-full-of-internets/">occasional contributor</a>; <strong>Eric Zhang</strong>, <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2011/05/10/magtrabaho-ka-manila-luzon-drag-and-the-politics-of-self-orientalization/">occasional contributor</a>; and <strong>Holly</strong>, <a href="http://www.feministe.us/blog/about-this-website/about-holly/">contributor at Feministe</a>.</p>

																			<center>
																				<strong>What types of messages did you receive about interracial relationships growing up?</strong>
																			</center><strong>N’jaila:</strong> It was very odd for me because while my father was Asian, I never felt like I or he was “mixed”. Growing up mixed was Black and White. Black and Asian just made Black and what was more important was my parents were West Indians. I don’t believe I even felt “mixed” or “Asian” until much later in life when I began dating myself. My parents did not see themselves as a mixed race couple so I did not see them that way. On television you never see Asian people with anyone other than whites so to me I always felt like dating inter-racially was code for dating white.

																			<p><strong>Elton:</strong> My mom doesn’t care who my sister or I marry as long as they are good, hardworking, honest people who live what she calls a “quality life.”</p>

																			<p>My family is part of a wave of Cantonese immigrants to the Southern United States that goes back to the 1930s or earlier. One of our forefathers is turning 100 this year. Another from that generation married a white waitress who worked at the first Chinese restaurant in the area. Their marriage lasted until death. Their mixed-race children are retirement age and a few served in the Army in the Vietnam War.</p>

																			<p>Despite the predominant media message, neither interracial relationships nor Chinese immigrants to America are anything new.</p>

																			<p><strong>refresh_daemon:</strong> My first generation Korean immigrant parents view of interracial dating has evolved a little since I was young. When I was younger, it was unfathomable to them that I would date someone who wasn’t ethnically Korean and so the particular message that I received growing up was a big “NO.” My father, having since moved back to Korea still holds to this view strongly, although only for me as being the first son has implications that do not extend to my younger siblings; for my younger siblings, I think his line of thinking is similar to my mother’s (although Korean beats all for him). My mother would prefer that I marry, in order: 1) A Korean American woman, 2) an Asian American woman, 3) a Korean woman, 4) a white woman. She’s become much more open since my youth, but she still has clear racial biases. Obviously, marriage preferences determine who it’s acceptable to be in a relationship with. As my father says, “Friends fine, but you can’t marry them.” <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2011/08/19/on-interracial-dating-the-asian-panel-1-of-3/#more-17113" class="more-link"></a></p>

																			<p>I was really about to title this roundtable “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aGTNS13SDU">Fuck the Pain Away</a>“, in honor of Sookie and Eric’s quest to have sex for <em>the rest of the season</em>. But that wouldn’t be fair to Skinwalking Tommy, the Marcus-Luna-Sam triangle, or Lafayette’s new drama. Kendra, Joe, Jordan, and Amber, join me to keep poking at True Blood plotlines.</p>

																			<p><strong>Pregame</strong></p>

																			<p><strong>Latoya:</strong> Just rewatched last week’s ep – did anyone else hear the gunshot right before Jess opened the door?<br>
																			<strong>Kendra:</strong> If I did, I’d forgotten. Whoops.<br>
																			<strong>Joe:</strong> Yeah, I assumed it was Jason shooting that idiot guard or Jason being shot at running to protect his hot ginge. And you know, just to blab some more: Reflecting on about the ending of last weeks episode, it reminded me of a quality of television not unlike Six Feet Under. Which, as we know, tends to not be true with this show. Message to Alan Ball: Schmaltzy pillow talk: bad. Drama, like this: good. Speaking of–</p>

																				<strong><br>
																				Jessica and Jason? Oh Boy…</strong>
																			</center><br>
																			<strong>Latoya:</strong> Oooh starting with Jess!<br>
																			<strong>Jordan:</strong> Oh look, he got her. Jason pulled a nice save on that.<br>
																			<strong>Kendra:</strong> They couldn’t possibly leave us hanging after last week!<br>
																			<strong>Latoya:</strong> Jason Fucking Stackhouse. Oh wait – once again, bad plan.<br>
																			<strong>Amber:</strong> This is sad. Hoyt is such a great guy and he’s inevitably going to get screwed over by the love of his life and his best friend. WOMP.<br>
																			<strong>Kendra</strong>: Good intentions… just always forgets to think things through. It’s a constant with him, even with how much he’s matured. (Speaking of, I keep forgetting they jumped ahead a year.)<br>
																			<strong>Latoya:</strong> Marnie and them had some serious timing when they stopped the chant. So wait – Jess didn’t die and Jase didn’t die…so the suspense continues.<br>
																			<strong>Joe:</strong> Aaaand the only vampire that’s died so far is black. How very Black Dude Dies First of you, TB.<br>
																			<strong>Kendra:</strong> Well, I officially support this relationship now, despite how badly this will end.<br>
																			<strong>Latoya:</strong> Will someone please think of Hoyt?<br>
																			<strong>Jordan:</strong> Back in the silver I guess<br>
																			<strong>Kendra:</strong> The SFX makeup people are really making their money this season.<br>
																			<strong>Latoya:</strong> LMAO<br>
																			<strong>Jordan:</strong> indeed. bless jason’s heart. He’s really trying to do the right thing by him. Boy code in action<br>
																			<strong>Latoya:</strong> And damn, does this mean Jase killed the guard outside?

																			<strong>Latoya:</strong> And all of this is getting really morally messy. And the new pack leader is kinda hilarious<br>
																			<strong>Kendra:</strong> “No you wouldn’t, you would be dead.” Most sensible person on the show, TBH.<br>
																			<strong>Jordan:</strong> Hmmm… new pack leader seems a bit smarter than I gave him credit for<br>
																			<strong>Latoya:</strong> Right? Marcus is the first sensible person I have seen on this show yet!<br>
																			<strong>Amber:</strong> Agreed. I am very impressed with his speech. Maybe the pack won’t be so bad for Alcide and Debbie after all…at least dude is not trying to get anyone killed.<br>
																			<strong>Jordan:</strong> The speaking sense mantle has been passed<br>
																			<strong>Latoya:</strong> Debbie is boning Marcus, isn’t she? If she hasn’t started, she will.<br>
																			<strong>Jordan:</strong> I love how Alicide towers over all of them<br>
																			<strong>Kendra:</strong> Alcide is on his way to First Mate status in the pack.<br>
																			<strong>Jordan:</strong> Debbie can’t handle it, she needs her men a little rougher around<br>
																			<strong>Latoya:</strong> Nah, you know he’s about to throw it all out the window for some sweet sunshine and spoiled wheat.<br>
																			<strong>Jordan:</strong> Ahhh.. back to Sookie<br>
																			<strong>Kendra:</strong> Staying away from Sookie is generally the best way for anyone to stay alive.<br>
																			<strong>Amber:</strong> And yet no one has learned that…except maybe Tara? But I have a feeling she’ll be running back too once it’s all over–if she doesn’t end up dead, that is. <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2011/08/18/spellbound-more-like-sexbound-true-blood-s4-s8/#more-17094" class="more-link"></a>

																						"'So, you have this 21st-century plantation that has been out there, where the Democrat Party has forever taken the black vote for granted. And you have established certain black leaders, who are nothing more than the overseers of that plantation. And now the people on that plantation are upset, because they have been disregarded, disrespected, and their concerns are not cared about.

																						"So when it comes to the dubious concept of “reverse racism,” I’m a literalist. “Reverse” means to go in the opposite direction. So in my book, “reverse racism” means reversing all the damages of racism. Only problem is, racism, once it has occurred, can’t truly be reversed.

																						<p>"But remedying racism cannot be confused with reversing it. Sadly and soberingly, 'reversing racism,' much like 'post-racialism,' is just not possible. To talk about either is delusional and disingenuous. There’s too much water, and blood, under the bridge."</p>
