																						"Jim Crow segregation survived long into the 20th century because it was kept alive by white Southerners with value systems and personalities we would applaud. It’s the fallacy of 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' a movie that never fails to move me but that advances a troubling falsehood: the notion that well-educated Christian whites were somehow victimized by white trash and forced to live within a social system that exploited and denigrated its black citizens, and that the privileged white upper class was somehow held hostage to these struggling individuals.<br>
																						But that wasn’t the case. The White Citizens Councils, the thinking man’s Ku Klux Klan, were made up of white middle-class people, people whose company you would enjoy.

																						"Such parents are certainly more disadvantaged than suburban parents, but that's not the point: To be demonstrably superior, selective charter school students should outperform comparable students in regular schools. Perhaps they do, but that has yet to be shown. And there is now considerable evidence that both KIPP and the Success Academies have high attrition rates. Students who don't succeed are encouraged or required to return to regular schools. For selective charter schools, this may not be bad policy, but it vitiates comparisons with regular neighborhood schools that must take all comers, including students who rebel against learning, those with expensive and difficult-to-treat disabilities, and those who flunk out of charters."

																						<p>"A photograph uploaded on Facebook of a white South African man posing like a hunter near an apparently lifeless body of a black child has created a furore as South African police try track him down.</p>

																						<p>"The man has a Facebook user profile with the name "Eugene Terrorblanche," an apparent play on the name of Eugene Terreblanche, an extremist Afrikaner leader murdered last year, and has 590 'friends' as of Saturday. Authorities are yet to confirm the authenticity of the undated picture and have not ruled out the possibility of photograph manipulation."</p>

																				<strong>Since minorities are seen in different lights (and with different accompanying stereotypes), what types of reactions have people had toward you and your partners? How are white partners perceived, as opposed to minority partners? Were any partners considered “off-limits” or “forbidden?”</strong>
																			</center>

																			<p><strong>Cecelia:</strong> I have been fortunate to be in spaces where I have not had odd reactions towards me and my partners. Generally, people have been interested in my Ojibway/Anishinaabe heritage in a very respectful way. Friends of the past and current friends have been very mindful and culturally sensitive towards me and my partners. In some cases where there have been comments made about me or my partner we were quick to stop the assault before it got bad.</p>

																			<p>White partners weren’t perceived as good because generally these folks [as individuals] were no good. They often did not take ownership for their various privileges even though they said they would attempt to. Where as minority partners were seen as good because they were good people. No partners were considered as off limits.</p>

																			<p><strong>Julie:</strong> When with white males, I would get the side-eye from other asians (they would be wary of me) but would get the approving nod from all whites, or other white/asian couples. Reactions from non-asian PoCs were along the lines of: “asian girl with white male, nothing new”. When cozy with other PoCs, I would be considered less than, different by anyone with oppressive tendencies, be they marginalized or not, and targeted.</p>

																			<p>White partners meant that I was less targeted for outright racist comments (but there was no end to the subtle ones). PoC partners meant that we were both targets (let the bulls out!), or that we were ‘so cute’ (let the condescension begin…).</p>

																			<p>White partners earned me the honorary white badge but since it’s not what I wanted, it didn’t matter. I preferred the approval of my asian peers. With asians, it was ok to be a PoC, and by extension, all marginalized bodies became visible. With whites, it was never ok to be unapologetically PoC/handicapped/marginalized except to provide exotic flavor.</p>

																			<p>Forbidden to date lesbian and very forbidden to be trans.</p>

																			<p><strong>Brandann:</strong> We’re a military family, and I think that adds an extra layer of stereotype, if you’ll bear with me for a moment. One of the most common interracial couples among military families, at least in our circles, is White Man/Asian Woman, which carries so many ugly stereotypes that it has basically become a trope, in my mind. We are read as the opposite of that, since I am read as white, much to my irritation.</p>

																			<p>Among the military I think there is a construct of gender and masculinity that does not exist outside in the civilian world, and often Asian men become shunted into a very narrow box of this stereotype. I think “white” is certainly seen as superior, even with all the military’s efforts to be racially sensitive, and despite the fact that Asian men are the largest and fastest growing demographic in the military. A white woman and Asian man flip the stereotype and I’ve noticed a lot of people have, in my opinion, a difficult time accepting this.</p>

																			<p><strong>May:</strong> I have been told that one of the biggest cultural taboos in regards to dating in the Arab American community is that of a relationship between an Arab female and a black male. Someone has even told me, “good luck trying to find an Arab guy who will marry you if you have been with a black man.” To further enforce the point, I know an Arab American female who “admitted” to dating a black male and made recipients of that information swear to keep the information mums lest it hurt her future marriage prospects. Although marrying someone who is white is also frowned upon, it is not on the same grounds for familial or cultural excommunication. <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2011/08/30/on-interracial-dating-the-outside-of-the-constructs-panel-2-of-2/#more-17382" class="more-link"></a></p>

																			<p>Welcome back to the Mixed Race panel on Interracial Dating. Our panelists are:</p>

																			<p><strong>Phil Djwa</strong>, technologist; <strong>Jozen Cummings</strong>, creator of the <a href="http://untiligetmarried.com/">Until I Get Married</a> blog; <strong>LM,</strong> long time commenter and friend of the blog; <strong>Liz,</strong> friend of the blog and co-founder of <a href="http://www.verysmartbrothas.com/">VerySmartBrothas</a>; <strong>Jen Chau</strong>, Founder and Executive Director of <a href="http://www.swirlinc.org/">Swirl</a> and co-founder of Mixed Media Watch and Racialicious; <strong>N’Jaila Rhee,</strong> the mastermind behind <a href="http://blasianbytch.com/">BlaysianBytch.com</a> (link NSFW); <strong>Holly</strong>, contributor at <a href="http://www.feministe.us/blog/">Feministe</a>; <strong>Ken</strong>, friend of the blog; and <strong>A.C.,</strong> friend of the blog.</p>

																					<strong>Unfortunately, often mixed people are seen as public property – the idea that anyone can walk up to a person and demand information on their parentage, background, nationality, or ethnicity. A similar dynamic is also something seen in interracial dating, where a couple simply being together in public can prompt unwelcome verbal and nonverbal commentary from passerby. Why do you think it is considered socially acceptable to do these things?</strong>
																				</center>

																				<p><strong>Phil:</strong> The “where are you from? No, I mean originally?” question used to drive me nuts, but I’ve calmed down a bit and try to be a little more positive in responding to the curiosity in the question rather than the ignorance. But it really has happened less. Sometimes now it’s “what are you” but that is usually after someone knows me a bit. I’m happy to talk about my heritage if someone asks politely.</p>

																				<p><strong>Jozen:</strong> Not to toot my own horn, but I’m extremely comfortable in my own skin and since I look mixed, I think it throws some people for a loop. A lot of mixed people play this role of having some sort of identity struggle, or they like to play up all their ethnicities, but that’s not me at all. So if I’m around a bunch of black folks who are unmistakably black (and this is the case 99% of the time), and I’m not missing one beat, not acting like an outsider in anyway. This causes a person on the outside looking in to wonder what am I? When I break it down for them, the reaction I get is usually, “Oh, okay.” And that “Oh” is funny because it’s almost like they were wondering why I was acting the way that I do or talking the way that I do, whatever it is. The other thing is, the group of people who ask me most often who I am is black people. Without a doubt, black folks are the ones who ask me most, “What are you?” I usually chalk this up to them not seeing enough black people in their life to understand black people look all types of different from other black people, mixed or otherwise. So the question is understandable. When people ask me what I am, and usually that’s the way they say it “What are you?”, I just think to myself it’s because they’ve never seen someone who looks like me before. When I told my high school counselor I wanted to go to Howard University she said, “You know I always wanted to ask you, what are you mixed with?” So that’s kind of what I mean, I was comfortable in the choice I made for college, and I think that made my high school counselor with asking me a question that prior to, she was uncomfortable asking.</p>

																				<p><strong>Liz</strong>: I think minorities have been treated like a commodity in this country long enough that it’s okay to talk to them any way you like.</p>

																				<p><strong>LM:</strong> This tends not to occur to me as an individual until after I’ve begun some sort of conversation, and my voice, or the subject matter, or my manner, something other than my phenotype or shade of skin causes them to ask, “What are you?” or some variation. I don’t mind. I’ve gotten the question from when I was in elementary school, though back then I think it was more of an institutional question — a class learning from where people’s parents or other ancestors came. (As I write this, I wonder first if my memory is right and second whether that sort of exercise would fly today (or if it’s commonplace).</p>

																				<p>In my relationships this has occurred but not much. On the whole the public acknowledgement that I’ve noticed and my partners have discussed has been positive — a smile here and there, mostly. There have been a handful of frowns over the years. There was one time outside of Savannah, Georgia this past year when my wife and I saw outright rudeness that seemed based on our inter-racialness — people in a vacation condo complex turning their backs on us when we said hello. But if anything we’ve encountered less of this than we’d have expected.</p>

																				<p>I don’t believe it’s socially acceptable at this point to react this way publicly. Of course not everyone behaves in a socially acceptable way, and particularly in communities with less exposure to inter-racial couples I can imagine things being different. And although I wish people in the United States — white people in particular — were better suited to talk about race publicly, doing so as a passerby ain’t the time. I’m not against people being curious, but curiosity ought not be intrusive.</p>

																				<p><strong>Jen:</strong> While I don’t always appreciate feedback or commentary from strangers, I have committed myself to anti-racism work and education. This means that I hold myself to a standard of no public fights, as little anger as possible, and mostly giving people the benefit of the doubt and trying to engage them. Looks and comments are the result of curiosity. And perhaps lack of exposure. You watch things to try to understand them. To study them. Sure, this feels rude sometimes, but I try to respond with kindness instead of hostility. If strangers look, I look back and smile. If strangers ask questions, I ask questions too. To “What are you,” I will reply, “I’m mixed, Chinese and White/Jewish – What did you think when you looked at me? And what are you curious about?”</p>

																				<p><strong>N’jaila:</strong> People seem to think that my identity is up for argument. I had a former manager ask me to my face, “ Well , your father can’t be all that Asian, your too dark and big to be Asian.” This man was mixed race himself, White and Puerto Rican. Not only was this ignorant because there are millions of brown Asians and big Asians but the fact that he was trying to argue with someone about the circumstances of their birth. As if my existence is somehow a bit less valid because I didn’t come out some fair skinned choco-dipped geisha. There’s an unspoken rule that I have to be what people see me as. I think that’s why I choose to identify as Blasian. I’m not a fraction of anything I’m a whole Blasian. <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2011/08/30/on-interracial-dating-the-mixed-race-panel-3-of-3/#more-17366" class="more-link"></a></p>

																			<p>DC Comics’ Deadman <a href="http://splashpage.mtv.com/2011/08/26/deadman-tv-series/">brought to television</a> by the folks behind <em>Supernatural?</em> Makes sense, if the story holds up.</p>

																			<p>Much like <em>SPN’s</em> Winchester brothers, Deadman (aka ghostly acrobat Boston Brand) would give showrunner Eric Kripke another outlet for his horror/comedy stylings. Since Boston has to possess people to do anything in the physical realm, one can only hope a Deadman TV show, if it actually <a href="http://www.comicvine.com/news/warner-bros-tv-ceo-on-why-wonder-woman-pilot-failed/143100/">gets past the pilot stage,</a> would actually <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2011/04/14/whats-not-going-bump-in-the-night-the-missing-folklore-of-supernatural-tv-correspondent-tryout/">feature more people who aren’t white.</a></p>

																			<p>But we wouldn’t bet on it.</p>

																			<p>Still, the biggest problem with Deadman is, before recent miniseries like <em>Blackest Night</em> and <em>Brightest Day</em> revived interest in him, DC played Boston as more of a “professional” guest-star, to be called upon for stories involving demons, posession and whatnot, crack wise with the core characters, then shuffle off back to the afterlife. And with DC’s “New 52″ relaunch starting tomorrow, it’s a good time to highlight characters who have come into greater prominence than Deadman over the course of the past decade, only to get passed up for bigger media opportunities.</p>

																						"This is life now for El General. This time last year, he was a 21-year-old university student. He was a big Tupac fan who'd recorded his own raps and posted them online, but even within the microscopic universe of Tunisian rap, hardly anyone knew who he was. Then, on November 7, 2010, he uploaded a song called "Rais Lebled" to Facebook. The date was significant: In Tunisia, November 7 was a national holiday commemorating the moment in 1987 when Prime Minister Zine El Abidine Ben Ali ended the 30-year reign of the previous president, Habib Bourguiba, with a bloodless coup. The song, whose title loosely translates as "President of the Country," is hardly a celebration: Over an eerie synth line and a simple, harrowing beat, El General searingly indicts Ben Ali. "Mr. President, your people are dying," he rhymes in rough, angry Tunisian Arabic. "They are eating garbage." He goes on to rail against police brutality, anti-Islamic policies, and institutionalized kleptocracy."

																			<p>Going to the MLK memorial dedications gave me quite a bit to think about. I struggled, a lot, with Dr. King’s messages of non violence growing up, and I am working on a piece about these different schools of thought and how they influence us. I was grateful to Xernona Clayton, for being <a href="http://storify.com/racialicious/mlk-memorial-women-in-civil-rights-lunch">so candid about her struggle with accepting nonviolence</a> while studying with Dr. King, because she articulated so much of what I felt.</p>

																			<p>So imagine my surprise this morning, while checking my feeds, to see this piece from Kenyon Farrow, titled “<a href="http://kenyonfarrow.com/2011/08/16/in-defense-of-brontez/">In Defense of Brontez—and the Rest of Us Too Proud or Too Trashy to Go Down Without a Fight.</a>” In it, Farrow describes a situation where a friend of his was subjected to homophobic comments, and what happened after the situation escalated:</p>

																			<blockquote>
																				<p>[H]e and friend/bandmate Adal had left the Paradiso nightclub when two Black men with some Caribbean accent began harassing them as they left the club. Adal is not queer, but the two men, according to Brontez, assumed that they were a couple, and began calling them “batty boy” and other epithets. Finally, they made the statement, “if we were at home you’d be dead by now.” <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2011/08/29/scattered-thoughts-on-violence-and-non-violence/#more-17398" class="more-link"></a></p>

																			<p>Welcome to the Outside of the Constructs panel. This one is a little strange as compared to the others. Originally, this was to be the panel for Indigenous people, but then I expanded it to include people who are normally outside of U.S. racial constructs. But then, we didn’t get very much response originally, and I asked for help recruiting. Cecelia responded, but she invited a mess of folks – but who didn’t fit the original idea for this panel. I was going to move Lyza, Julie, and Richard’s responses – but then I realized their experiences probably fit a bit better here, since they were radically different from other responses on the White and Asian panels. So, it all worked out.</p>

																			<p>Our panelists are: <strong>Cecelia</strong>, friend of the blog; <strong>Julie</strong>, friend of Cecelia; <a href="http://www.randombabble.com/">Brandann</a>, friend of the blog and <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2010/04/06/wopajo/">occassional contributor</a>; <strong>Lyza</strong>, friend of Cecelia; <strong>Andrew</strong>, blogger at <a href="http://www.kabobfest.com/">KABOBFest</a>; <strong>May</strong>, blogger at <a href="http://www.kabobfest.com/">KABOBfest</a> and <a href="http://sawahasumra.blogspot.com/">Sawaha Sumra</a>; <strong>Fatemeh</strong>, Racialious crew and Editor of <a href="http://muslimahmediawatch.org/">Muslimah Media Watch</a>; <strong>El</strong>, long time friend of the blog; and <strong>Richard</strong>, friend of Cecelia.</p>

																				<strong>What types of messages did you receive about interracial relationships growing up?</strong>
																			</center>

																			<p><strong>Cecelia:</strong> My parents are an interracial couple. My Dad is Ojibway/Anishinaabe (enrolled tribal member in the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community) and French and my Mother is various European heritages, the majority of her is Scandinavian (Norwegian and Swedish) and German. When my parents started dated my Mother’s Father said to her, “the only good Indian is a dead Indian.” Despite the one negative message from my Grandfather my parents tried their best, with all of the complications, family issues and life stresses, their overall message on their interracial dating was a positive one. My Dad grew up in Highland Park, MI which was what he called “mixed” and not diverse. He once described the neighborhood he grew up in by having “all the colors.” My Mother grew up in a working class, product of Ford and auto industry, mostly white inner ring suburb of Detroit. They moved to a more lower middle class neighborhood of an inner ring suburb and the compilation of their upbringings gave me a positive message about interracial dating, even despite our struggles as a family and individuals inside the family unit. Because of our various struggles from generational trauma, historical trauma and PTSD from being survivors of genocide on the Native side, I came to the conclusion that most relationships would be a struggle. This struggle can change as well heal. If our liberation and return to culture, language and traditions as Native people means feeling our ancestors pain then it may manifest in struggle within our family and therefore the interracial relationship of my parents.</p>

																			<p>My family on my Dad’s side is multi-racial, so mixing was already in the family and our family gatherings had all of us mingling which was most always a positive space for me. I am really thankful for my family being so awesome and open-minded! Some messages I received from my Dad (which he said weekly, if not daily): “the white man messed up everything,” and/or “don’t trust whitey.” Therefore, I wasn’t very trusting of white males in relationships, although I have had my share, I have retired dating white males because my Fathers statement that was ingrained in me since I was a child has proven true in the dating world. Sadly, I had to test the waters to prove his statements to be true.</p>

																			<p><strong>Julie:</strong> Light-skinned = good. Dark-skinned = bad. Gay/lesbian also = bad. The races fell into those guidelines.</p>

																			<p>I grew up Vietnamese in a predominantly white area where they pulled eyes at me and made fun of my parent’s height and accents. As a displaced people who were just trying to survive, and as we watched other PoCs in our neighborhood/family turning to drugs and guns, assimilation seemed like the key to our well-being. I was surrounded by the ‘goodness’ of white people (some were pretty nice, but ignorant) and was brought up to appreciate them and to adopt their ideas, including their racist ones.<br>
																			I may have received these messages, but more than what I was ‘sold’, was the fact that I was a target for racism (Seventeen Magazine was definitely not written with PoC in mind) and thus differentiated. I grew wary of white people and started gravitating to other races for my friendships (mostly latino and asian) in my late teens.</p>

																			<p><strong>Brandann:</strong> I grew up mixed-race, and only slightly conscious of what that meant. I am assuming that my being a product of a mixed-race relationship meant that my family didn’t frown upon the idea of interracial dating or relationships.</p>

																			<p>I’m Ojibwe/Anishinaabe and European by descent, registered with the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians. If there were problems with such relationships, there was no indication of it from my immediate family. Though, as I got older and understood racial identity better (things such as the endearing nickname my father’s father gave me, which was a bit of a jab at my mixed-heritage but meant to be affectionate), I noticed that other people within my own community had ideas about what was right and what was less-than. Relationships between two Native people, at least in my own limited experience, were looked upon more favorably than those between Native and non-Natives.</p>

																			<p>The only time race ever arose as an issue was when I met my husband, who is Asian. My grandfather is a Korean War veteran, and I personally had fears that it would be an issue, however right or wrong that fear was. Turns out, it was never something I needed to worry about. He was accepted with open arms.</p>

																			<p><strong>Lyza:</strong> Growing up in a rural farm community, where my mom grew up in a suburb of Grand Rapids and my dad grew up on a farm in Rockford, MI(which back when he grew up there it didn’t have the reputation it does today), allowed me to have a simple growing up experience that was for the most part homogeneous(white working class to middle class) in nature of where we lived. My mom was very intentional(coming from a Civil Rights and Feminism background) when it came to making my brother and I aware that the world was not homogeneous in nature she would yearly take us out of class to walk downtown Grand Rapids during the Martin Luther King Jr. day parade, as well as have literature and different avenues where we would be challenged with how we viewed the world from where we lived.</p>

																			<p>I thank my mom for being so progressive and going against the norm of ignorance that was prevalent in the community that we grew up in. My dad came from another generation where rural was rural and the only people of color in town were generally from the city and didn’t plan on staying any time soon. When I was in my early twenties I dated a Latino man that I worked with and after a date where he dropped me off at the home and met my family my dad sat me down and asked me what my intentions were with him and if I planned on dating him seriously. This comment disturbed me because of the undertone of racism that happened to ooze out of the comment. That was when I realized that there was a standard when it came to dating, and I was at a point in my life where I decided that was not acceptable. Within the past 3 years my father has changed his world view considerably with some hard life lessons that have come his way as well as my consistent challenging of how the world really “is” with all of the double standards.</p>

																			<p>My Grandpa (mom’s side) has been very adamant that interracial dating is unacceptable, however his deep seeded racism comes from generationalism and growing up in Benton Harbor pre and post WWII era. I constantly challenge his worldview by giving him an opportunity to explain why he has these views towards specific groups of people and offer him a different POV. Bringing some of my friends with diverse backgrounds to family events has allowed him to be around people that challenge where his fears and racism hold so closely to his belief system.</p>

																			<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> I grew up in Ann Arbor, MI after having spent the first four years of my life in New York City. My mother immigrated from Lebanon in the late 70s and my father’s family, also Lebanese, has been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century. On a personal level, both of my parents have always disregarded cultural traditions in favor of their own interpretations of what’s right and wrong or how people should and should not behave. For example, my mother was 31 when she married, which is virtually unheard of in a culture that pressures its women to marry young, and was the first woman to leave her village in Lebanon. Although there are far fewer social expectations imposed on men than on women in Arab culture, my father seemed to buck the trend by maintaining an air of humility despite his charm, intelligence, and professional success.</p>

																			<p>As a result, despite the fact that my upbringing was definitely defined by my Arab identity, I was always encouraged to challenge and confront cultural norms and traditions, and push social and personal boundaries within reason. When it came to sex and relationships, my parents never shied away from having conversations with me about relationships and sexuality, yet they rarely came off as nosey or intrusive. They have always encouraged me to view dating as a process through which I develop a better understanding of myself and what it is I’m looking for in a partner. Although I haven’t seriously dated a woman that isn’t Arab, I am confident that my parents would support an interracial relationship.</p>

																			<p>Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about my extended family. My grandmother (father’s mother) enjoyed being racist and would regularly claim that she was no Arab; she was Phoenician. She never missed an opportunity to obsess over the kinds of people her grandchildren would date and eventually marry, regularly encouraging all of us to date within our Arab Orthodox Christian community. Such attitudes are reinforced by the rest of my father’s family which, interestingly enough, embrace culturally traditional values and lifestyles despite being third and fourth generation Arab Americans.</p>

																			<p>On my mother’s side, I grew up knowing that interracial relationships were frowned upon and not taken seriously. This obviously did not extend to Europeans; my cousin was once married to a French woman. I should add, though, that my family is definitely more concerned with religion than they are race when it comes to relationships. This is because they assume that their children will not marry/date outside of the Arab community, and so they focus on religious identity. My Shiite Muslim (now ex) girlfriend definitely ruffled a few of their feathers, but I was never openly confronted about my relationship with her. As a man, I recognize that I enjoy significant privilege and am not subject to the kind of scrutiny Arab women must endure.</p>

																			<p><strong>May:</strong> As a US born and raised to Syrian Sunni Muslim parents, I grew up watching both sides of my family interracially/ethnically marry—it was almost exclusively my uncles though, and to mostly white European women. As Syrians are regarded as the white people of the Arab world, I would venture to say that these kinds of unions were not only considered culturally acceptable, but a reinforcement of an aspirational whiteness.</p>

																			<p>Further complicating the fact that both my parents are Syrian (my father with a Bedouin background) was the culturally enclavish way I was raised. We lived on a cul-de-sac with all my father’s family populating the six model homes that the track housing in the sleepy Southern California suburb was based on. Thus not only was I encouraged to maintain a link with my “roots” but I was also expected to only have my cousins as my friends. As my father once retorted when I asked to attend a schoolmate’s sleepover party, “Friends? why do you need friends? You have cousins!” So you can imagine the jingoistic way marriage was regarded/viewed. <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2011/08/29/interracial-dating-the-outside-the-constructs-panel/#more-17374" class="more-link"></a></p>

																			<p>Welcome back to the Mixed panel on Interracial Dating. Our panelists are:</p>

																			<p><strong>Phil Djwa</strong>, technologist; <strong>Jozen Cummings</strong>, creator of the <a href="http://untiligetmarried.com/">Until I Get Married</a> blog; <strong>LM,</strong> long time commenter and friend of the blog; <strong>Liz,</strong> friend of the blog and co-founder of <a href="http://www.verysmartbrothas.com/">VerySmartBrothas</a>; <strong>Jen Chau</strong>, Founder and Executive Director of <a href="http://www.swirlinc.org/">Swirl</a> and co-founder of Mixed Media Watch and Racialicious; <strong>N’Jaila Rhee,</strong> the mastermind behind <a href="http://blasianbytch.com/">BlaysianBytch.com</a>(link NSFW); <strong>Holly</strong>, contributor at <a href="http://www.feministe.us/blog/">Feministe</a>; <strong>Ken</strong>, friend of the blog; and <strong>A.C.,</strong> friend of the blog.</p>

																			<center>
																				<strong>It’s been said that mixed race people, by their very nature, are always in a mixed race relationship (unless they find someone of their exact same racial background). Do you think this is true?</strong>
																			</center>

																			<p><strong>Phil:</strong> That’s a funny way to put it. I guess so, but it seems more common now, so less of an issue. My wife jokes that I am whiter than she is. Still, I think for me, differences are there. No one can quite tell what I am, or what my kids are, so there is some ambiguity there. I remember being in Hawaii and thinking/feeling I had come home because of all the people looking like me. I don’t suffer the same things my parents did, and that makes it seem less of an issue. Racism expressed directly to my face is pretty rare now, it’s been years, but sometimes I feel it even if it isn’t overt.</p>

																			<p><strong>Jozen:</strong> Short answer: Hell no. Long answer: HHHHHEEEEEEELLLLLLLL NOOOOO! But no really, this is probably the most ridiculous stereotype I’ve heard about mixed race people. If I end up with a woman who is mixed race it’s probably cause I thought she was fine, however that came about really doesn’t matter.</p>

																			<p><strong>LM:</strong> Sure. But the degree to which this matters depends a lot on the experiences of the people in the relationship, and to go to the other extreme a good argument can be made that just about every relationship is of mixed race.</p>

																			<p><strong>Liz:</strong> Yeah, technically speaking. I’m very proud of both my cultures and don’t see myself excusing my Navajo side with my future family.</p>

																			<p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yes, though I never quite understood the need to point this out. There is a woe-is-me quality to it, a la “Aw geez. I am alone in the world, no one is just like me, racially, so I am doomed to only interracial date.”</p>

																			<p>First of all, interracial dating is fabulous. Just ask the women out there writing books about it recently….Secondly, there are a ton of people like me out there. I tried to date a Jewish and Chinese guy once and everyone thought he was my brother, so… pros and cons. Seriously speaking, though, I think that things like socio-economic class, values, and belief system, can sometimes trump race when contending with differences in a relationship. Sure, anyone you date is probably going to have a different “racial” make-up than you if you are mixed, but I think there are probably other differences that wind up being more meaningful than the fact that you are from different “races.”</p>

																			<p><strong>N’jaila:</strong> I think this goes for those that “look” mixed. I think even though I’m part Asian dating an Asian man feels to me like an interracial relationship because we are judged by those outside the relationship as a completely different. I think a lot of people feel that people’s races should be dictated by what others perceive them as, and not how the person self identifies. I have friends that are half White half Black and a lot of times if they don’t “look” mixed. People act negatively to them dating one race or the other. <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2011/08/29/on-interracial-dating-the-mixed-race-panel/#more-17360" class="more-link"></a></p>
