(And y’all know we were yelling our heads off at the finale.)  Tune in next week for the last roundtable and a couple surprises.  Until then, chew on this:</p><p>Inside TV – “<a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/09/12/true-blood-rutina-wesley-seasonfinal/">Rutina Wesley talks last night’s shocking finale and the future of Tara</a>”</p><blockquote><p><strong>In your mind, is Tara dead?</strong></p><p>Well I mean half my head is missing. I’m just gonna keep saying that. You know, it’s True Blood. I feel like anything is possible. If anything, it is the golden hour though. If she is able to be saved, it’s like she’s got 20 seconds. It’s not a lot of time. I’m curious to see what they’re going to do with all of it. I hope I’m back. But again half my head is missing [laughs].</p><p><strong>Maybe Tara will just wear a lot of hats?</strong><br> Yeah I mean yeah she can wear a lot of hats. Put some gauze on it. But people are going crazy! [Laughs]</p><p><strong>It was crazy! Are people approaching you?</strong><br> Well my phone has been blowing up. I talked to Nelsan and his phone was blowing up. He was like, “People are about to start a riot over you.” I think that’s so sweet to know that people out there are really upset and some people are like, “I’m not watching the show anymore!” I’m like, C’mon guys. But it’s not over. It ain’t over til the fat lady sings. I’m just gonna take it one day at a time. As I said, I haven’t seen any scripts from next season, but I know that I’m involved — I just don’t know in what way.</p><p><strong>Are you signed on for a season 5?</strong><br> Yeah. It’s out there that Alan has already said that he has big plans for Tara. But things change. I don’t know exactly what they have in store for me and how long that will be. It’s tricky. And if I did know, I’m just not going to say.

A Black, lower-middle-class kid, skinny and somewhat socially awkward, whose method of dealing with problems usually involved his wit rather than his fists, capable of using such terms as “Pythagorean renown” for no real reason other than they sound pretty and prone to breaking into a capella renderings of the theme to The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly at the drop of a hat? It was as if McDuffie and co-creator John Paul Leon had based the character on me. I faithfully bought every issue each month until the series ended in the late 90s.</p><p>When I was in college, I was pleased to see the character brought into the mainstream with the Static Shock animated series on the WB, happy to see Milestone’s highest-profile character get the respect and appreciation he deserved in mass-market media. It proved something I’d always maintained about the character: that Static, more so than Black Panther, Icon, or Hardware, was actually capable of appealing to all comic book readers, not just Black ones. Like Spider-Man, he was a bright young man who dealt with the problems middle-class youth have to face; like Spider-Man, he grew up in an urban environment, part of a faceless anonymous class of people in an enormous city. Like Spider-Man, he wanted to work his way up from his circumstances; like Spider-Man, he had to do it with his brains, not his body. The difference—and this was a difference large enough to ensure the character was far from derivative—was that Virgil Hawkins was Black, and lived a life according to this social experience.</p><p>In essence, Virgil Hawkins lived the kind of life Spider-Man would have lived, had he been Black.<br> - From “Why Virgil Hawkins Is More Significant Than Miles Morales,” on <a href="http://www.komplicated.com/2011/09/opinion-static-miles-morales-and-black-heroes-darrylzero.html">Komplicated.com</a></p></blockquote><div class="clear"></div></div><div class="tags"> Tagged with: <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/tag/miles-morales/" rel="tag">Miles Morales</a> • <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/tag/milestone-entertainment/" rel="tag">Milestone Entertainment</a> • <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/tag/marvel-comics/" rel="tag">marvel comics</a> • <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/tag/static-shock/" rel="tag">static shock</a><br>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div class="post-17871 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-advertising category-asian-american category-black category-race category-storytelling category-technology tag-citibank tag-justin-lee tag-mit tag-oliver-yeh tag-racebending fpost " id="post-17871"><div class="post-meta fix"><div class="post-header fix post-nothumb" style=""><div class="post-title-section fix"><div class="post-title fix"><h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2011/09/15/lost-in-space-a-look-at-citibanks-racebending-new-ad-campaign/" title="Lost In ‘Space’: A Look At Citibank’s Racebending New Ad Campaign" rel="bookmark">Lost In ‘Space’: A Look At Citibank’s Racebending New Ad Campaign</a></h2><div class="metabar "><em><span class="sword">By</span> <span class="author vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="http://www.racialicious.com/author/guest/" title="Posts by Guest Contributor" rel="author">Guest Contributor</a></span></span> <span class="sword">On</span> <span class="date time published" title="2011-09-15T10:00:05-0400">September 15, 2011</span> · <span class="post-comments"><a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2011/09/15/lost-in-space-a-look-at-citibanks-racebending-new-ad-campaign/#disqus_thread" data-disqus-identifier="17871 http://www.racialicious.com/?p=17871">16 Comments and 28 Reactions</a></span> </em></div></div></div></div></div><div class="entry_wrap fix"><div class="entry_content"><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/FF1zTb_pbfU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><em>By Guest Contributor Jonathan Vogeler</em></p><p>This summer, Citibank began running an advertising campaign that features three young men embarking on a project, financed by the bank, to photograph Earth from space, using a weather balloon and off-the-shelf equipment.

García</em></p><p>The image above is the last page of DC Comics’ new <em>Suicide Squad</em> #1, which debuted yesterday. And to the chagrin of many fans thus far, the woman in the panel on the left is writer Adam Glass and penciller Marco Rudy’s “reimagined” take on <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Amanda_Waller_%28New_Earth%29">Amanda Waller.</a></p><p><img alt="" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6152/6149548488_9661c9510b_m.jpg" class="alignright" width="194" height="240"> In her original incarnation, seen at right, the woman known as “The Wall” was notable not only for being a non-superpowered human with the confidence and cunning to stand up to the likes of Batman, but to be consistently presented as DC’s resident spymaster (she was frequently involved with prior incarnations of the <em>Dirty Dozen</em>-like Squad), but for being depicted as powerful without looking like the “superhuman ideal.”</p><p>The character has also emigrated onto other media platforms. CCH Pounder voiced an animated version of Waller in the <em>Justice League Unlimited</em> animated series; Pam Grier played her on television during the final season of <em>Smallville;</em> and earlier this year, Amanda Bassett stepped into the character for the movie <em>Green Lantern.</em> That said, Waller’s involvement as a “star” in the comics has primarily been restricted to espionage-type titles like <em>Suicide Squad</em> or <em>Checkmate,</em> where she was part of an ensemble. She’s never been called upon to carry a title on her own.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6182/6148896217_47d0849123_m.jpg" class="alignleft" width="156" height="240"> Which makes the decision to revamp the character – whether it was Glass and Rudy’s choice, or something dictated to them by DC head honchos Dan DiDio, Jim Lee and Geoff Johns – even more ill-considered than their decision to draw up a Suicide Girls-like character (seen at left) and call her <a href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Harley_Quinn">Harley Quinn.</a> What made Waller unique was that she really <strong>did</strong> look like a regular person – she just had enough of an iron will to maneuver herself into a position of power. For DC to seemingly transform her into one more skinny gal seems to be a particularly arbitrary choice in a company-wide relaunch that has already divided its’ existing fanbase. Or, if this move was made in order to entice new readers to give the new <em>Squad</em> a shot, then who does this company exactly want to attract? <a href="http://www.myteespot.com/images/Images_d/d_7387.jpg">This guy?</a></p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Glass <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/09/15/adam-glass-on-the-thinner-younger-amanda-waller-in-suicide-squad-1/">was quoted by Bleeding Cool</a> as saying, “Amanda Waller is not defined by her size but by her attitude and she still has plenty of that.” Which doesn’t explain the change at all, of course. Bleeding Cool also reported that Rudy has been replaced as the penciller for the series in favor of Federico Dellocchio.</p><div class="clear"></div></div><div class="tags"> Tagged with: <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/tag/adam-glass/" rel="tag">Adam Glass</a> • <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/tag/amanda-waller/" rel="tag">Amanda Waller</a> • <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/tag/angela-bassett/" rel="tag">Angela Bassett</a> • <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/tag/cch-pounder/" rel="tag">CCH Pounder</a> • <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/tag/marco-rudy/" rel="tag">Marco Rudy</a> • <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/tag/pam-grier/" rel="tag">Pam Grier</a> • <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/tag/dan-didio/" rel="tag">dan didio</a> • <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/tag/dc-comics/" rel="tag">dc comics</a> • <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/tag/geoff-johns/" rel="tag">geoff johns</a> • <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/tag/jim-lee/" rel="tag">jim lee</a><br>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div class="clear"></div></div>

																			<p>Her recommendations:</p>

																			<blockquote>
																				<p>1. Asian women are not equatable to Asian food. Even if you’re hungry.<br>
																				2. You’ve cultivated an impressive catalogue of 80′s war movies. Well done sir. But the sidewalk is not your mother’s basement and I am not an internet forum. Keep the movie quotes to yourself.<br>
																				3. Pop culture references that invariably suggest someone is foreign, submissive/docile, or willing to service you sexually should always be avoided. In other words: find a new fetish.<br>
																				4. Seriously, when has anything referencing the Vietnam war ever gotten anyone laid? (Stanley Kubrick, who knew your legacy would be Asian female street harassment?)<br>
																				5. If the first thing you think of when you see an Asian woman is “I should ask her to feed me,” you should know you’re not fit for human companionship. Period. Get a rice cooker. It won’t care if you fetishize it.<br>
																				6. This is America; assume the Asian female you’re chatting with is American. Talk to her about red vs. blue politics, her favorite type of pie, who is better: Katy Perry or Ke[s]ha, or at the very least, baseball – not about foods that use chopsticks. Your ability to feed yourself is an accomplishment – but she doesn’t need to know that.</p>
																			</blockquote>

																			<p>Caitlin’s video was hilarious. I’ve heard all these stories – and so much more! – from my Asian American friends over the years. And, if I was queen of the airwaves, I’d have this running as a PSA, along with other notices about street harassment in general. But there’s one thing that keeps sticking out in my mind, and it’s generally the same refrain we hear over and over again when we post abut street harassment: the idea of men watching the vid and going “What am I supposed to say then?” (Yeah, just headdesk and move on.)</p>

																			<p>I always think about a certain verse on Murs’ “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ8bYfbm45A">Dark Skinned White Girls</a>,” a song that’s really problematic despite its good intentions. The verse about mixed girls was fairly revealing about the mindset of these kind of guys (emphasis mine):</p>

																			<blockquote>
																				<p>Now half and half of mixed girls<br>
																				I know what the battle be<br>
																				Everytime you go out it’s “whats your nationality?”<br>
																				Everybody always wanna dig up in ya background<br>
																				You don’t look… now how does that sound?<br>
																				I couldn’t tell you were… oh is that right?<br>
																				Do you take it as a compliment or start up a fight?<br>
																				Venezualan and Indian, Rican and Dominican<br>
																				Japanese or Portuguese, Quarter of Brazilian<br>
																				White and Korean, Black and Pinay<br>
																				We’ll find out later<br>
																				It don’t matter, ya fly<br>
																				<strong>It don’t really matter to most of us guys<br>
																				We just need an excuse to get close or say “hi”</strong></p>
																			</blockquote>

																			<p>Somehow, it never seems to matter what the woman likes or appreciates, which is this unexplored dimension of street harassment. If the objection to women protesting street harassment is that we should forgive a man’s clumsy attempts to pick up a woman he finds attractive, then wouldn’t not offending a woman be pretty high on that man’s priority list? But there’s no way to yell out “sucky sucky five dollar” at a woman passing by and <em>not</em> be offensive. So there’s clearly another motive at play. What is it? What makes racism so appealing for street harassers?</p>

																						<p>Street harassment, even when it’s not racialized, always feels like an attempt to “put me in my place” as a woman. To remind me what I’m for, so to speak.

																						<p>I often complain that “diversity” programs aren’t designed to address the concerns of minority groups. They’re put in place for the amusement of the privileged majority, who can choose to dabble in the exotic for a moment if they have free time, and then safely return to being dominant.</p>

																						<p>A similar attitude is expressed when presumably well-intentioned men stoop to racism to get attention from women of color. It’s all about the man. It’s all about his need for attention. He claims to want to get to know the woman better, but what he really wants is for the woman (or any woman, really) to get to know HIM better.</p>

																						<p>Peacocking is an ancient evolutionary strategy that men use to win the competition for a woman’s attention. Men say offensive things to get attention BECAUSE IT WORKS. To disarm this strategy, then, women should not give their attention to men who say offensive things.</p>

																						<p>“To disarm this strategy, then, women should not give their attention to men who say offensive things.”</p>

																						<p>As a young woman who has experienced the whole spectrum of street harassment on my college campus, I can assure you that ignoring the men who’ve harassed me has not always been successful. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve ignored the accoster only to have them essentially stalk me until I acknowledge them. I kid you not.</p>

																						<p>One guy made it very clear that he refused to leave me alone until *I* took down *his* phone number. Another time, a whole group of guys shouted out for all to hear many lewd and disgusting remarks about me as they followed behind. I was scared and humiliated beyond reason but it wasn’t until I made it plainly known that I wasn’t interested that they finally stopped. I’m not saying that ignoring your harasser never works; just that it’s not always a guaranteed solution.<br></p>

																						<p>The funny thing, is that discussions like this (the food and the background parts, anyway) at Couchsurfing meetings, for example, don’t always have the same racial-tension undertones, especially not in Ireland. There really is just an attempt to learn about each other, often based on appearance, accent, who you know, etc. It’s plain ol’ curiosity. Our landlord, in fact, subjected me to a small battery of questions like that when I first moved her from Italy (I’m American, husband is Italian). He pointed out that, before about 6 years ago, there just weren’t too many people in Ireland besides Irish folks. Seeing a black person, for example, was unusual, though there was no hostility involved. It just was. (His explanation.)Definitely good to be aware — and beware — of assumptions you make, but be kind, too. People are trying their best. If they are ignorant, help ‘em out a bit. There are a buhjillion times I’ve put my foot in my mouth about cultural differences, mostly while trying to learn about them. I try to make it clear that I’m aware of my limitations and ignorance, but still manage to be a doof sometimes.I’ve also experienced the covert, “I know you’re one of us” white person racism from time to time. On the west coast of the US, it’s most often about Latinos, and I am part Mexican. On a few occasions I found myself too dumbfounded to say anything when someone made a racist comment about Mexicans. Now I say something, as gently as a I can, but I am not afraid to get loud if someone persists in being an ass. …gotta pick your battles, though.As far as objectifying a woman, that’s something that crosses race lines around the world. Not all cultures are patriarchal, but there does seem to be a common idea that a woman should be flattered simply for getting attention, no matter how it minimizes her as a human being. As a female, and a petite one at that, I have definitely experienced that. I can’t just vilify socially awkward/unaware men across the board, however, as I have (as previously mentioned) a pretty good idea about what my shoe tastes like. Whenever possible, I try to mix kindness and calling b.s.</p>

																						<p>I agree. Street harassment seems to be a method of punishing women/girls for daring to leave the house without a male chaperone. Harassment only happens when I am solo or with other women. All it takes is one man to be walking with me or a group of women and no harassment will take place.</p>

																						<p>Elton, I think your comments are coming from a good place but are a little naive. You seem to presume that women haven’t already *tried* the tactic of ignoring harassers. Along with a million other tactics: Ignore, defer, confront, run.</p>

																						<p>The tactic that gets us out of trouble with Harasser A might only serve to enrage Harasser B. It’s a crapshoot.

																						<p>I don’t think there is much of a difference between a failed pick up and street harassment. A lot of dudes yelling in the street are trying to pick somebody up, or at least acting like they are. Some of that might have to do with class, I’ve been harassed by all kinds of guys, the more privileged the more insistent and violent, but working class guys in working class neighborhoods are more likely to approach you publicly in the street. Or maybe it has to do with the harassees and how they are being classed and raced by their harassers.<br>
																						I don’t know, what do folks think? I think some of it has to do with an idea of ownership over somebody’s body, even the non-threatening kind of “cat-calling.” Black and brown women, transgender folks are more likely to be the victims of this kind of sexual violence for a lot of reasons all of which have to do with some kind of racism.</p>

																						<p>While I agree that assuming a USian audience can at all times be problematic, I think that in this case there is a reason for Caitlin saying, “…assume the Asian female you’re chatting with is American.”</p>

																						<p>The reason is that many non-Asian USians automatically assume that Asian people are different, foreign, non-USian, and as the video suggests, these markers of foreignness (funny language ! funny food habits! omgomg! etc) get used as the tools for “getting to know” the young lady in question. I think of the latest episode of Awkward Black Girl (<a href="http://www.awkwardblackgirl.com/episodes" rel="nofollow">http://www.awkwardblackgirl.com/episodes</a>) in which White Jay takes Jaye on what he thinks is a black people date (jumbalaya and beat poetry) when she was expecting to go out for some sushi or something.</p>

																						<p>I’m not sure who you’re talking to,<br>
																						nicthommi, but if you’re addressing me, then none of the statements you’re<br>
																						attributing to me are in my post.</p>

																						<p>(i) I never suggested that guys harassing<br>
																						Asian women in the street were “unaware of their own racism.” That<br>
																						was specifically — and by specifically, I mean *numbered as a completely<br>
																						separate point* — a comment about the guy on the couch telling the woman how<br>
																						much he respects her culture as he haphazardly tries to guess what that culture<br>
																						is. Obviously, he’s not complimenting her at all but reducing her very being to<br>
																						an hors d’oeuvres tray of clichés.<br>
																						Depressingly, he doesn’t even know he’s doing it.</p>

																						<p>Of course street harassment that is racist is<br>
																						consciously so.</p>

																						<p>(ii) Pointing out someone’s unconscious<br>
																						racism is never a justification of it, let alone, a celebration of it.<br>
																						Knowing the difference, however, can inform the way one deals with it.</p>

																						<p>(iii) The imaginary guy I quoted (note quote<br>
																						marks enclosing the statement) is illustrating the concept of unconscious<br>
																						racism by stating that his stereotyping is “supportive.” Nowhere in anything I’ve ever posted in my<br>
																						short bleak life will you find me saying that stereotyping a person is a compliment.</p>

																						<p>(iv) I never claimed that “something<br>
																						like 1 billion women are nothing more than one-dimensional caricatures” to<br>
																						*me*. I’m saying that, specifically,<br>
																						it’s true of the guys you see in the video (and parenthetically of the kinds of<br>
																						guys I’ve had to endure for my entire life).</p>

																						<p>(v) When you wrote “the line of thinking that<br>
																						you have demonstrated is on[e] big problem,” you failed to understand that the<br>
																						line of thinking I’m analyzing is not only a big problem but one that I’m<br>
																						*actively condemning*. In order to<br>
																						respond to reprehensible behavior, I find it useful to try to understand that<br>
																						behavior first. That’s all I did in my post: Attempt to delineate the<br>
																						thinking of the oafs who do these things.</p>

																						<p>Ever since I was a little kid and saw how my biracial mother<br>
																						was treated as a public schoolteacher and at parties with supposedly<br>
																						blue-blooded in-laws, I’ve either tried to argue with people who stereotyped<br>
																						women based on race or lain in bed sick to my stomach at the things I’d heard<br>
																						men saying. These aren’t views I hold<br>
																						because they’re popular or approved.<br>
																						They’re the thoughts of a person who’s been sickened by his own family’s<br>
																						casual debasement throughout his life.</p>

																						<p>(This might appear under a different name than Bob Gordon — there have been different logins for Disqus since Engadget’s security was breached — but the discrepancy is not deliberate and I’m still the same user in bothe cases. I just don’t have access to my password lists at work.)</p>

																						<p>Although the video is attempting to make a point through lighthearted humor, let’s not forget that such behavior can lead to violence. I remember when I was a kid, about 7 or 8 my mother would make me go to the store with my 16 year old sister at night. I remember how guys would harasser her and how much it pissed me off. I am just lucky they never attacked her because I am not sure how much I could have done to protect her.</p>

																						<p>She lives in an ideal world that I have never experienced. I carry myself with a definite assertiveness, look men straight in the eye instead of dropping my head and trying to make myself smaller, and yes, confront harassers on a daily basis. At times I’ve had to get physical with it I learned early on that being soft and acquiescent to strangers doesn’t allow you to get where you are trying to go.</p>

																						<p>I’m quite challenging in my attitude when on the street and possess the skills to back it up, being a life long martial artist with championship titles under my belt. Didn’t happen to you once, eh? Perhaps that’s why you have the delusions that you do which dictate that it’s our “attitude and demeanor” that spurs these men on.

																						<p>Um, what? Ignoring male harassers is what I usually do, as an introverted person. I’m so good at it, I can even continue carrying a conversation with another woman without missing a beat. It doesn’t always work, though. If I am alone, sometimes they think I’m not reacting because I don’t understand English, and they start telling me in English that I don’t understand them because because I only speak Chinese. Then they might start saying racist stuff to me because they think I don’t understand English and/or won’t get the cultural references to those movies about Asian women.</p>

																						<p>Seriously, most of the stuff that heterosexual men do doesn’t work. I always wonder how it’s possible that men don’t know how to interact with women. You would think there should be some kind of innate, evolved module to help men reproduce, but there isn’t. It’s a mystery to me how the human race continues to reproduce.</p>

																						<p>I mean, do you honestly think that the men who say “Sucky sucky five dolla” are more sexually successful than those who know not to say things like that? Is it that cocky men who say such things are likely to overstate their success with women, similar to how self-reported penis sizes are unreliable?</p>
