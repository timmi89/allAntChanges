Folk-art motifs, fine art and domestic manufacturing are also mainstays for the emerging designer. After her thesis collection at the Pratt Institute found rave reviews in 2012 and receiving the inaugural Liz Clairborne Concept to Product Award, Kelsy ventured out on her own straight out of school and never looked back.<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.garmentory.com\/sale\/boutiques\/brooklyn\/carleen\">Shop Carleen &gt;<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>ARE YOU A NATIVE NEW YORKER OR TRANSPLANT?\u00a0<\/strong>Transplant! I\u2019m California born and raised but New York was calling me when it came time to apply for college and I\u2019ve been here ever since.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS IN BROOKLYN?\u00a0<\/strong>Currently I call Bushwick home, and my studio is here too. I\u2019m fortunate to have it just a few minutes away and I\u2019m really happy with it all. The only bummer is not being closer to the garment district, it makes me really careful about planning productive trips into the city.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHAT DO YOU LOVE MOST ABOUT BROOKLYN?\u00a0<\/strong>My neighborhood and my dog. New Yorkers have a reputation for keeping to themselves, but if you start walking a puppy you\u2019ll make a lot of friends. We got a puppy named Poppy back in April and she is way more of an extrovert than my boyfriend and I are. Also, my actual friends that I\u2019ve had almost as long as I\u2019ve lived here, it wouldn\u2019t be the same without them. Some are from back in my first days at NYU who don\u2019t have any connection to the fashion industry and some are friends from working and creating here in New York. It\u2019s been really nice to build that sense of community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BEST PLACE TO EAT IN BROOKLYN?\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.brucienyc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Brucie<\/a><\/span> has been my favorite restaurant in NYC for four or five years but they\u2019re closing for good on February 15th so hurry up and get over there! Seriously everything that comes out of that kitchen is amazing and it\u2019s always a good time. I don\u2019t go often enough. I also love Tacoway Beach (fka Rockaway Taco) and their amazing fish tacos \u2013 by far the best tacos I\u2019ve ever eaten on the east coast and totally worth the train ride out.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>COLD PICNIC, Phoebe Sung<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/magazine.garmentory.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/brooklyn-designer-cold-picnic-phoebe.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4268\" src=\"http:\/\/magazine.garmentory.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/brooklyn-designer-cold-picnic-phoebe.png\" alt=\"brooklyn-designer-cold-picnic-phoebe\" width=\"640\" height=\"960\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Known for luxe leather, macrame and cheeky textiles, Phoebe Sung is one part of the design duo behind this genius collection of home goods and accessories that just keeps getting better.

Our neighborhood is on the border of Bushwick, so depending on what map you look at, sometimes we&#8217;re Brooklyn and sometimes we&#8217;re Queens.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHAT DO YOU LOVE MOST ABOUT BROOKLYN?\u00a0<\/strong>I love that I never feel like I&#8217;ve truly got to the bottom of it. I&#8217;ve lived in other cities where I felt a bit restless after a few years and that hasn&#8217;t happened here yet. It&#8217;s so big, and there&#8217;s enough to do in all the neighborhoods that, even if you do get sick of where you&#8217;re living or where you usually hang out, there&#8217;s always something totally new a few miles away.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BEST PLACE TO DRINK IN BROOKLYN?\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.stmazie.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">St. Mazie<\/a><\/span> in Williamsburg has delicious cocktails.

After all, we\u2019ve been making stuff together for 20+ years! We\u2019ve come a long way from paper dolls, but we still have the same sort of casual, playful approach to working together. We can be totally honest without ever hurting each other\u2019s feelings, and we pretty much agree on everything anyway.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HOW DO YOU GET INSPIRED EACH SEASON?\u00a0<\/strong>Each season we like to focus on a different element of nature \u2014 whatever we\u2019ve encountered in our day-to-day lives that sort of sticks in our head. Here\u2019s an example: a couple years ago, our dad, who\u2019s a marine biologist, started collecting algae specimens from the coast of Charleston. He would press them into paper to create beautiful pieces of preserved artwork. We scored a couple pieces ourselves, and even tried our hand at making some. The next spring, we couldn\u2019t stop thinking about those delicate, fascinating silhouettes, so we developed a print using scientific illustrations of seaweed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BEING IN TWO DIFFERENT CITIES, WHAT&#8217;S YOUR PROCESS LIKE?<\/strong>\u00a0Lots of email! We text, phone, and email every day to check in. Leah lives in New York, so she works closely with our factory to develop new styles. Becky lives in Austin, where she works on marketing and e-commerce.\u00a0We also meet up several times a year for big events, like market week or our biannual photo shoots.

I just kind of went for it, learning from experimenting and trying to narrow my point of view as a designer. In 2013, I began pursuing REIFhaus full time and slowly expanding my product offerings.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>TELL US ABOUT YOUR SLOGAN. <\/strong>&#8220;The time is ripe&#8221; is a direct translation of a German phrase &#8220;die Zeit ist Reif&#8221;. My last name is Reif (pronounced like Rife) which means &#8216;ripe&#8217; in German. I thought that word and phrase was the perfect way to describe the design process, taking an idea full circle from concept to actual physical product.\u00a0 Ripening, if you will.\u00a0 Also, when I was first starting my line, that phrase really resonated with me. I had spent many years honing in on my style and aesthetic, and I felt like the &#8216;time was ripe&#8217; to release my designs to the world.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>HOW DO YOU FIND INSPIRATION?\u00a0<\/strong>I find inspiration from so many different places.\u00a0 Usually, it&#8217;s a detail. A subtle detail that strikes a chord with me and takes me on a tangent somewhere. It could also be a texture, a color, or something as simple as a mismatched paint swatch on a wall.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>TELL US ABOUT YOUR DESIGN PROCESS.\u00a0<\/strong>I usually start with a few details or ideas that I like, and then narrow that down through sketching, selecting textiles, and actually patterning garments to find out if those ideas are actually going to be wearable. Usually my ideas shift, sometimes pretty substantially from the initial concept to the final product.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>WHAT WAS YOUR INSPIRATION FOR SPRING?\u00a0<\/strong>SS16 is inspired by the female artists associated with the Bauhaus movement. There were so many amazing women weavers, painters, potters and designers during that era that often get overlooked, but were critical to the overall movement. Many of the designs have a subtle inspiration of the 1930&#8217;s era of fashion, when many of these women were creating their art.<\/p>\n","shop_links_title":"Shop

a lot of amazing women doing amazing things around the world, but there&#8217;s a serious concentration of talent in Brooklyn right now.\u00a0The\u00a0duo behind <a href=\"http:\/\/www.local-creative.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Local Creative<\/a>, a collaborative lifestyle project, are dedicated to celebrating just that and are as much a part of the movement as they are its champions. Nicole Steriovski and Jenna Saraco\u00a0tell the stories of local creatives, artists and entrepreneurs with their blog and creative services, focused on where we live, shop, travel and gather. &#8220;While introducing our audience to these new communities and experiences, we hope to strengthen their awareness of how each potential purchase can affect the people around them. Bringing the focus back to a local, sustainable economy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re big fans, so we asked\u00a0them\u00a0to curate their personal picks\u00a0from the Garmentory community of indie boutiques and emerging designers.\u00a0Here, Nicole shares her love for turtlenecks, experimental style and the beauty of a slip dress.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHAT\u2019S YOUR PERSONAL STYLE PHILOSOPHY?\u00a0<\/strong>Timely over trendy is always a thought that stays with me. I do like experimenting with the look of the moment but I still lean toward classic, timeless pieces that you can grow with.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHAT\u2019S THE BEST FASHION\u00a0ADVICE YOU\u2019VE EVER RECEIVED?\u00a0<\/strong>It\u2019s most important to dress for yourself. If you feel good you wear the clothes and they don\u2019t wear you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHO IS YOUR STYLE ICON?\u00a0<\/strong>Too many! Charlotte Rampling, Sofia Coppola, Lauren Hutton, Anna Karina, Jane Birkin, Bianca Jagger, Liv Tyler.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR PERSONAL WARDROBE STAPLES?\u00a0<\/strong>For winter: a neutral long wool coat, turtleneck, cropped jeans and a solid pair of boots.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE BROOKLYN STYLE?\u00a0<\/strong>Free. In Brooklyn you can experiment with different styles and not feel judged. People express themselves through the way they dress and it seems to be no big thing. I love that because I felt challenged creatively when it came to what I wore sometimes living in the Midwest.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/magazine.garmentory.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/nicole-local-creative-kordal-sweater.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4324\" src=\"http:\/\/magazine.garmentory.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/nicole-local-creative-kordal-sweater.png\" alt=\"Nicole of Local Creative in Kordal Sweater\" width=\"640\" height=\"960\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN:<\/strong> Cancer<br \/>\n<strong>FUN FACT:<\/strong> I like puns.<br \/>\n<strong>DRINK ORDER:<\/strong> Old Fashioned.<br \/>\n<strong>STANDBY SNACK:<\/strong> Apples or hummus.<br \/>\n<strong>NATIVE NEW YORKER OR TRANSPLANT?<\/strong> Transplant.<br \/>\n<strong>WHAT NEIGHBORHOOD IN BROOKLYN DO YOU LIVE AND\/OR WORK?<\/strong> Greenpoint &#8211;

            <p>We like to call it Babetown, USA. Brooklyn is home to some of our favorite designers that also to happen to be some of our favorite people. So, in celebration of our <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.garmentory.com/sale/all/brooklyn-babes-sale" target="_blank">Brooklyn Babes Sale</a></span>, we got a few of them together at Samantha Pleet&#8217;s studio to find out what they love most about this New York City borough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>KELSY PARKHOUSE, Carleen</strong><a href="http://magazine.garmentory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn-babe-designers.png"><br />
</a> <a href="http://magazine.garmentory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn-designer-carleen-kelsy-parkhouse.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4267" src="http://magazine.garmentory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn-designer-carleen-kelsy-parkhouse.png" alt="brooklyn-designer-carleen-kelsy-parkhouse" width="640" height="960" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Though she’s based in Brooklyn, designer Kelsy Parkhouse continues to find inspiration in her southern California roots for Carleen, her line of cool, quirky women’s wear. Folk-art motifs, fine art and domestic manufacturing are also mainstays for the emerging designer. After her thesis collection at the Pratt Institute found rave reviews in 2012 and receiving the inaugural Liz Clairborne Concept to Product Award, Kelsy ventured out on her own straight out of school and never looked back.</p>

<p><strong>ARE YOU A NATIVE NEW YORKER OR TRANSPLANT? </strong>Transplant! I’m California born and raised but New York was calling me when it came time to apply for college and I’ve been here ever since.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS IN BROOKLYN? </strong>Currently I call Bushwick home, and my studio is here too. I’m fortunate to have it just a few minutes away and I’m really happy with it all. The only bummer is not being closer to the garment district, it makes me really careful about planning productive trips into the city.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO YOU LOVE MOST ABOUT BROOKLYN? </strong>My neighborhood and my dog. New Yorkers have a reputation for keeping to themselves, but if you start walking a puppy you’ll make a lot of friends. We got a puppy named Poppy back in April and she is way more of an extrovert than my boyfriend and I are. Also, my actual friends that I’ve had almost as long as I’ve lived here, it wouldn’t be the same without them. Some are from back in my first days at NYU who don’t have any connection to the fashion industry and some are friends from working and creating here in New York. It’s been really nice to build that sense of community.</p>
<p><strong>BEST PLACE TO EAT IN BROOKLYN? </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.brucienyc.com/" target="_blank">Brucie</a></span> has been my favorite restaurant in NYC for four or five years but they’re closing for good on February 15th so hurry up and get over there! Seriously everything that comes out of that kitchen is amazing and it’s always a good time. I don’t go often enough. I also love Tacoway Beach (fka Rockaway Taco) and their amazing fish tacos – by far the best tacos I’ve ever eaten on the east coast and totally worth the train ride out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>COLD PICNIC, Phoebe Sung</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://magazine.garmentory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn-designer-cold-picnic-phoebe.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4268" src="http://magazine.garmentory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn-designer-cold-picnic-phoebe.png" alt="brooklyn-designer-cold-picnic-phoebe" width="640" height="960" /></a></p>
<p>Known for luxe leather, macrame and cheeky textiles, Phoebe Sung is one part of the design duo behind this genius collection of home goods and accessories that just keeps getting better. She founded Cold Picnic in 2010 with her fiancé Peter Buer after working in fine arts and corporate fashion design. The pair met in 2006 while attending school in Boston and have been living and working together every since.</p>

<p><strong>ARE YOU A NATIVE NEW YORKER OR TRANSPLANT? </strong>We had family here so when I was a kid I visited a lot, but I grew up in a suburb of DC and lived in Philly and Boston before finally moving to New York with Peter about four years ago.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS IN BROOKLYN? </strong>We recently bought a house in Ridgewood, so we live on the first floor and converted the basement into a studio. Our neighborhood is on the border of Bushwick, so depending on what map you look at, sometimes we&#8217;re Brooklyn and sometimes we&#8217;re Queens.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO YOU LOVE MOST ABOUT BROOKLYN? </strong>I love that I never feel like I&#8217;ve truly got to the bottom of it. I&#8217;ve lived in other cities where I felt a bit restless after a few years and that hasn&#8217;t happened here yet. It&#8217;s so big, and there&#8217;s enough to do in all the neighborhoods that, even if you do get sick of where you&#8217;re living or where you usually hang out, there&#8217;s always something totally new a few miles away.</p>
<p><strong>BEST PLACE TO DRINK IN BROOKLYN? </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.stmazie.com/" target="_blank">St. Mazie</a></span> in Williamsburg has delicious cocktails. It has that sort of hazy elegant &#8217;20s vibe a lot of places seem to be going for, but better, somehow. I love that there always seems to be another nook or cave or garden to hide in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ELLEN VAN DUSEN, Dusen Dusen</strong> <a href="http://magazine.garmentory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn-designer-dusen-dusen-ellen.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4269" src="http://magazine.garmentory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn-designer-dusen-dusen-ellen.png" alt="brooklyn-designer-dusen-dusen-ellen" width="640" height="960" /></a></p>
<p>Ellen Van Dusen designs clothing with psychology in mind. Specifically, the brain’s reaction to visual stimuli. The result? A namesake label that focuses on universally flattering styles featuring happy, look-at-me prints that redefine retail therapy. The Brooklyn-based designer started Dusen Dusen in 2010 and has since expanded her contemporary line of women’s wear into fashion for the home.</p>

<p><strong>ARE YOU A NATIVE NEW YORKER OR TRANSPLANT? </strong>I grew up in DC and went to college in Boston. I’ve been on the East Coast all my life, but New York feels like home to me now. I’ve been here for 8 years.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR NEIGHBOURHOODS IN BROOKLYN?</strong> I live in Fort Greene and my studio is in Williamsburg.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO YOU LOVE MOST ABOUT BROOKLYN?</strong> I love the all the different kinds of people that live here, especially in my neighborhood. It’s diverse in a lot of different ways: age-wise, racially, economically, it’s all across the board.</p>
<p><strong>THE BEST PLACE TO PEOPLE WATCH IN BROOKLYN?</strong> I like to sit in Fort Greene Park in the summer. It’s great for people <em>and</em> dog watching.</p>

<p><a href="http://magazine.garmentory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn-designer-mandy-kordal.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4271" src="http://magazine.garmentory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn-designer-mandy-kordal.png" alt="brooklyn-designer-mandy-kordal" width="640" height="960" /></a></p>

<p><strong>ARE YOU A NATIVE NEW YORKER OR TRANSPLANT? </strong>I am a transplant from Cincinnati Ohio, but moved around a lot growing up, we rarely stayed anywhere for more than three years. I’ve been living in New York for seven years now and it’s now become the place that feels most like home.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS IN BROOKLYN?</strong> I live in Crown Heights in Brooklyn and I love our neighborhood! My studio is at the Brooklyn Fashion Design Accelerator, which is in the old Pfizer building on Flushing Ave.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO YOU LOVE MOST ABOUT BROOKLYN?</strong> I would have to say the people. I feel very lucky to have a great group of friends that all live close by and have been such an inspiration and support system for me. Getting everyone together to hang out in Prospect Park in the summertime is the absolute best.</p>
<p><strong>BEST PLACE TO EAT IN BROOKLYN? </strong>Oh that is a hard one, depends on your mood but my favorite spot is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.caferuedix.com/" target="_blank">Café Rue Dix</a></span>. My sister makes fun of me because I go there so often that now I know all the staff. It’s a French Senegalese restaurant café and it’s perfect for just grabbing a cup of coffee or a glass a wine, and the food is amazing.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>LEAH PLANTE, Plante</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://magazine.garmentory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn-designer-leah-plante.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4270" src="http://magazine.garmentory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn-designer-leah-plante.png" alt="brooklyn-designer-leah-plante" width="640" height="960" /></a></p>
<p>Leah Plante and her sister Rebecca, founded their namesake line in 2013 and it finds inspiration in the combination of nature and the city. While living in separate cities (Leah is in Brooklyn and Rebecca in Austin), the Plante sisters create novel and feminine pieces using organic and natural, locally sourced materials. All pieces are made in New York&#8217;s historic garment district.</p>

<p><strong>ARE YOU A NATIVE NEW YORKER OR TRANSPLANT? </strong>I am a transplant! I grew up in Charleston, SC and moved to Manhattan after graduating from college upstate. I lived there for about five years before moving to Brooklyn.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS IN BROOKLYN? </strong>I live and work in Park Slope.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO YOU LOVE MOST ABOUT BROOKLYN? </strong>I&#8217;m not sure! I love the quaint architecture, cool shops and restaurants, and many green spaces. But one thing that struck me as so nice – and so different from Manhattan – when we first moved here was that people leave books out on their stoops for their neighbors to take for free. So thoughtful! Plus, I have gotten a couple good books out of it.</p>
<p><strong>BEST PLACE TO PEOPLE WATCH IN BROOKLYN? </strong>The Brooklyn Botanical Gardens. There are babies, couples on first dates, Brooklyn gals in cute dresses&#8230; plus you get to walk around in nature.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SAMANTHA PLEET</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://magazine.garmentory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn-designer-samantha-pleet.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4272" src="http://magazine.garmentory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn-designer-samantha-pleet.png" alt="brooklyn-designer-samantha-pleet" width="640" height="960" /></a></p>
<p>Any good description of Samantha Pleet&#8217;s eponymous line must start with a list of cool girls. Jenny Slate, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Lena Dunham, Yael Stone, Tavi Gevinson, Lorde, Haim, Jenny Lewis are all fans of her modern, girly designs. She established her epoynmous line in 2007 after her graduation from the Pratt Institute and now works alongside her husband Patrick. Their line combines equal parts of mysterious, fantastical and modern taking inspration from music, art, history and literature. Their signature silhouettes are consistently featured in the best fashion magazines and worn by the best girls.</p>

<p><strong>ARE YOU A NATIVE NEW YORKER OR TRANSPLANT? </strong>I’m a “real” New Yorker. I have been here for 16 years and I feel that if you have spent seven years here you should consider yourself a New Yorker. I grew up in Philadelphia, which is the next city over so it’s close enough but NYC is the one I chose.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS IN BROOKLYN? </strong>I live in Greenpoint and work in Williamsburg. I love that my studio is walking distance from my apartment.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO YOU LOVE MOST ABOUT BROOKLYN? </strong>At any moment you can get the best meal, the best coffee and have the opportunity to meet the most interesting people in the world, whether they live here or they are just passing through.</p>
<p><strong>BEST PLACE TO EAT IN BROOKLYN? </strong>I’m really into <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://glasserienyc.com/" target="_blank">Glasserie</a></span> right now, I always have a restaurant obsession and that is where you will find me. It’s the most amazing Middle Eastern-inspired healthy food in a beautiful setting. The best part is that it is deep in Greenpoint and is a little hard to get to, so you never have to wait to long for a table.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WRAY SERNA, Wray</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://magazine.garmentory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn-designer-wray.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4273" src="http://magazine.garmentory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn-designer-wray.png" alt="brooklyn-designer-wray" width="640" height="960" /></a></p>
<p>Wray Serna studied design at California College of the Arts and continued her studies at Parsons Paris before launching her namesake label for Spring/Summer 2015. Her debut collection was featured in the pages of <em>Vogue</em> and garnered a fast, loyal following in New York City.

<p><strong>ARE YOU A NATIVE NEW YORKER OR TRANSPLANT? </strong>A native New Yorker I am not but I have lived here for almost eight years so I feel pretty connected to the city. My family is from Connecticut and they live less than two hours away so I have always felt my roots growing even deeper in the East Coast.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS IN BROOKLYN? </strong>I live and work in Greenpoint, it&#8217;s a quiet neighborhood next to the water. I love living here mostly because it is mellow and has a wonderful vibe to it.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO YOU LOVE MOST ABOUT BROOKLYN? </strong>Brooklyn is so vast with so many neighborhoods that I would have to say that I like the history of it all. I also love the food in Brooklyn.</p>
<p><strong><strong>BEST PLACE TO PEOPLE WATCH IN BROOKLYN? </strong></strong>I am going to have to say that Bushwick has a great vibe for emerging style and people watching. It is mostly compromised of Latin American families and very hip young people. When I go there I feel like I am getting to see some real New Yorkers at their best. I love seeing what people put together, there are a fair amount of emerging designers and artists that live there.</p>
