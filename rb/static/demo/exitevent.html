They will discuss exactly how aggressive you have to be to acquire customers and where to draw the line, if anywhere. </i><a href="http://internetsummit.com/agenda/">The panel will be Wednesday, 11/12, at 2:50 p.m.</a></div></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i>In this second in a series of articles with his panelmates, Joe sat down with WedPics co-founder Justin Miller.</i></div><div><br /></div><div><div>I love the way <b>Justin Miller</b> does things. He does them big. For instance, soon into the lifespan of his first venture, the dejaMi venue-based media sharing app, he decided that the way to get his app noticed among the plethora of media sharing apps that had suddenly hit the market was to make his beta test very public. What resulted was <a href="http://joeprocopio.com/bringing-sexy-back-why-deja-fest-is-more-than-a-launch-party.asp">the two-day, 26-band dejaFest back in 2011</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>This was genius. This was old-school, dot-com era bravado in a region that was just at the dawn of rebuilding its startup population. What's more is that dejaFest wasn't just about the app, it was about revitalizing Raleigh and the Triangle and making it more than IBM, where Justin himself had come from, and maybe Red Hat, if people knew what that was.</div><div><br /></div><div>And you know what happened?</div><div><br /></div><div>It didn't work. It spectacularly didn't work.</div><div><br /></div><div>Well, no. It worked for what it was intended to do. dejaFest went off with few hitches and rave reviews, bringing all kinds of new attention to dejaMi. But the onslaught in the app economy was just beginning and there was no escaping the gravity.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'll admit, even I was skeptical of the discovery factor of dejaMi, though I never doubted Justin as an entrepreneur, or his model, or his skills at building a highly-usable, well-designed, class-act app. It was just that there was way too much noise and he didn't have the funding and the region didn't have the ecosystem to create enough signal in that quagmire.</div><div><br /></div><div>Justin saw this too, but he didn't give up. Instead, he doubled down. Through the summer of 2012, Justin and co-founders Idan Koren and Andy Heymann hunkered down in his basement to rebuild the next version of dejaMi into the first version of WedPics. I got a close-up of this process through Justin contracting with one of my employees, and the fever pitch to build and release this app never stopped, even through <a href="http://joeprocopio.com/raleigh-startup-dejami-gets-booted-from-office.asp">getting booted from that basement and serendipitously landing at HQ Raleigh</a>, where the office is still located today.</div><div><br /></div><div>Justin didn't so much raise a seed round as he built a seed round, pulling funds in from friends, family, partnerships, sponsorships, basically by any means necessary. When we had a chance to catch up at SEVC in Charlotte in March 2013, he was sort of raising institutional money but sort of didn't need to. At that point, out of beta and right on the verge of the 2013 wedding season, WedPics wasn't really on anyone's radar, although the adoption metrics he divulged during his presentation were already impressive. </div><div><br /></div><div>At the end of that conversation, we had one of my favorite exchanges ever.</div><div><br /></div><div>"How much are you looking for?"</div><div><br /></div><div>"A million."</div><div><br /></div><div>"Yeah, you'll get that."</div><div><br /></div><div>And he did. Coming out of SEVC (most of it already secured, I think I can divulge that now), <a href="http://joeprocopio.com/called-it-wedpics-raises-an-oversubscribed-11-million-round.asp">WedPics raised an oversubscribed $1.1 million seed round</a>. Now everyone knew who they were, and that 2013 wedding season would be explosive. By the mid-point in August, WedPics was up to 2,200 weddings per weekend, most of the adoption coming virally (as opposed to via gigantic, head-achey music festivals). </div><div><br /></div><div>"We knew we were onto something big with WedPics," says Miller, "because it wasn’t just another photo-sharing app in the sea of photo-sharing apps. This idea came with a brilliantly simple 'ah-ha' comparison or use case. It replaces the need for disposable cameras at weddings, and this immediately resonated with everyone."</div><div><br /></div><div>In 2014, WedPics announced a $1.5 million Series A, with a 10x increase in users and content.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you think there's something odd about a bunch of single young men -- and I might add tattooed single young men who eschew suits, ties, shaving, and sensible haircuts -- building the fastest-scaling app in the $100 billion wedding industry by repurposing a live show app from a basement in Raleigh, NC, you're not alone. And neither is the irony lost on Justin.</div><div><br /></div><div>"The juxtaposition of our company make-up with the industry is incredible," he says, "and I truly believe our success can be attributed to the fact that we were able to break into this market with a completely different perspective. We’re a bunch of dudes that don’t -- or should I say ‘didn’t’ -- know the first thing about weddings, and this proved to be to our advantage. I like to think of it as the 'Wizard of Oz' effect -- perception in front of the curtain and behind the curtain."</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://joeprocopio.com/mostly-legal-marketing-eric-boggs-and-revboss.asp">In my last post on the Mostly Legal Marketing panel</a>, I mused that Eric Boggs and I had found our pursuit of rock-stardom in the relatively less sexy world of building products and companies. Justin markets like a rock star, whether it's music festivals or weddings. All it took was a pivot to a vertical that, while just as noisy and crowded, could still be dominated. </div><div><br /></div><div>Then, as he is known to do, he went big.</div></div>

                                This week, I had the pleasure of attending <a href="http://www.internetsummit.com">Internet Summit 2014</a>. <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;">The technology ecosystem of the Triangle was an entirely different landscape four years ago, when I first attended conference. I have seen the conference grow (to 2,200 people this year!) and adjust its offerings for the local and increasingly national community. </span><div><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;">Outside of the showcased talent, my favorite aspect of the Summit continues to be the breakout sessions available to attendees. This year, a notable roundtable session was on the Internet of Things and a 5-Year Outlook of Disruptive Tech in the industry, helmed by <b>Rebecca Lieb</b> of Altimeter Group, <b>Blair Reeves</b> of IBM Digital Analytics, <b>Robert Richardson</b> of TechTarget, and <b>Michael Schinelli</b> of Kenan-Flagler Business School. This panel of diverse leaders in the tech and marketing space hyped IoT as the next huge advancement in technology. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;">The Internet of Things allows everyday devices to be interconnected through the Internet at large, using sensors and software provided by various existing platforms and business infrastructure. Lieb described a scenario as follows: “Imagine your next generation printers being shipped with sensors notifying manufacturers when printer ink is running low. By already having your contact information registered and having a partnership with Staples, your printer at home can notify you of discounts on your printer ink at your local Staples store before you even run out in the first place.” </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;">“The Internet of Things allows companies a unique opportunity in the future: having unique brand and product relationships directly with their end users,” said Richardson. This will directly impact tech marketing efforts of the future, as consumers can have new and varied experiences without even having to leave their homes. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;">Data that is currently stuck in a “static” activity will become responsive and dynamic as the ecosystem of the Internet of Things develops in the coming years.
Data from this new global ecosystem will power everything we own and use daily. Devices being interconnected is not a new concept. However, cross-platform compatibility will be the key to an open and functional future. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;">As our very own <b>Joe Procopio </b></span><a href="http://exitevent.com/article/a-common-language- for-the-internet-of-things-14714">wrote earlier this year</a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;">, standardization of the Internet of Things will be huge for the future and a crucial step towards making the ecosystem a lasting presence. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;">Locally, the Internet of Things has also had a fair amount of traction, with a </span><a href="http://www.meetup.com/NC-RIoT-Regional-Internet- of-Things/">monthly meetup</a> series now with nearly 300 members<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;">. Local fixture <b>Scotty Moody</b> recently launched a new Triangle-based startup focused on the Internet of Things called </span><a href="http://www.k4connect.com/">K4Connect,</a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;"> and </span><a href="http://www.exitevent.com/article/six-one-minute-pitches-140926">several IoT companies demoed </a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;">at the CED Tech Venture Conference in September.￼￼￼￼￼ </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14.4444446563721px; line-height: 22.2222232818604px;">Yesterday's keynote speaker <b>Steve Wozniak</b> wrapped up his comments with some warnings about the technology that will make IoT truly effective.

I have seen the conference grow (to 2,200 people this year!) and adjust its offerings for the local and increasingly national community. </span><div><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\">Outside of the showcased talent, my favorite aspect of the Summit continues to be the breakout sessions available to attendees. This year, a notable roundtable session was on the Internet of Things and a 5-Year Outlook of Disruptive Tech in the industry, helmed by <b>Rebecca Lieb</b> of Altimeter Group, <b>Blair Reeves</b> of IBM Digital Analytics, <b>Robert Richardson</b> of TechTarget, and <b>Michael Schinelli</b> of Kenan-Flagler Business School. This panel of diverse leaders in the tech and marketing space hyped IoT as the next huge advancement in technology. </span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\">The Internet of Things allows everyday devices to be interconnected through the Internet at large, using sensors and software provided by various existing platforms and business infrastructure. Lieb described a scenario as follows: “Imagine your next generation printers being shipped with sensors notifying manufacturers when printer ink is running low. By already having your contact information registered and having a partnership with Staples, your printer at home can notify you of discounts on your printer ink at your local Staples store before you even run out in the first place.” </span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\">“The Internet of Things allows companies a unique opportunity in the future: having unique brand and product relationships directly with their end users,” said Richardson. This will directly impact tech marketing efforts of the future, as consumers can have new and varied experiences without even having to leave their homes. </span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\">Data that is currently stuck in a “static” activity will become responsive and dynamic as the ecosystem of the Internet of Things develops in the coming years.\r\nData from this new global ecosystem will power everything we own and use daily. Devices being interconnected is not a new concept. However, cross-platform compatibility will be the key to an open and functional future. </span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\">As our very own <b>Joe Procopio </b></span><a href=\"http://exitevent.com/article/a-common-language- for-the-internet-of-things-14714\">wrote earlier this year</a><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\">, standardization of the Internet of Things will be huge for the future and a crucial step towards making the ecosystem a lasting presence. </span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\">Locally, the Internet of Things has also had a fair amount of traction, with a </span><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/NC-RIoT-Regional-Internet- of-Things/\">monthly meetup</a> series now with nearly 300 members<span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\">.

After lots of last-minute bookings, frenzied “fitting-my-life-into-a-bag,” and red-eye bus rides, I found myself at the doors of Washington, D.C.’s Sidney Harman Hall, ready to be seated in an auditorium filled with remarkably passionate people, all restless to talk about our time’s most pressing issues.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.42857143;\"><br /></span></div></span></div></div><div><div class=\"media_container\" style=\"\">\n    <div class=\"media_embed\" style=\"\">\n        <img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/media/2014/11/54655b69482fcaa508e133e8-1415928681378.jpg\" style=\"\"/>\n        <div class=\"well well-sm media_caption\" style=\"\">Photo Courtesy of AtlanticLIVE.</div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>With our appetites primed for important topics, it was almost a no-brainer that Ebola would be on the menu. What I wasn’t expecting, however, was that it would be one of the  conference’s main meals. Everyone from tech gurus to acclaimed novelists were asked for their opinions, making me wonder...Is Ebola really that big of deal? Especially with the press’s recent criticism towards our nation’s “fanatical” response (see EliteDaily’s sensitively-put <a href=\"http://elitedaily.com/news/world/why-you-shouldnt-buy-into-the-ebola-hype/784344/\" target=\"_blank\">“9 Reasons Why You Need To Calm The F*ck Down About Ebola in America”</a>), were the organizers of the event just overreacting?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No. I soon learned that the conversation about Ebola tells us a lot, not only about infectious disease, but several bigger, important trends in our society. In particular, Ebola teaches us about the necessity for:</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><b>Storytelling. </b></h4><p>Award-winning author of <i>Americanah</i>, <b>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</b>, expressed that America’s response to Ebola perpetuated the danger of a “single story” (see her widely-viewed TED talk <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story?language=en\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>) about Africa as a continent needing help. The way we craft a narrative around a person, a place, an idea, an event, or a product defines how people will perceive it. Stories are important. Founder of <a href=\"http://www.notimpossiblelabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Not Impossible Labs</a>, <b>Mick Ebeling</b>, has worked in teams to create life-saving products in ocular recognition and prosthetics. But these developments have come from the desire to help one person, one friend—by pursuing a happy ending to one story, Ebeling has achieved fairy tales for thousands. The power of an idea lies in the way its story is told.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><b>Collaboration.</b> </h4><p>Ebola, and communicable disease, is the responsibility not just of one country or one continent, but the world. This means that we will have to work harmoniously and effectively through global partnerships, since we are, as U.S. National Security Advisor <b>Susan Rice</b> claims, “only as strong as the weakest link” in the fabric. </p><div><div class=\"media_container\" style=\"\">\n    <div class=\"media_embed\" style=\"\">\n        <img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/media/2014/11/54655b84482fcaa508e133ee-1415928708320.jpg\" style=\"\"/>\n        <div class=\"well well-sm media_caption\" style=\"\">Photo Courtesy of AtlanticLIVE.</div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n</div><p><br /></p><p>Cross-national collaboration becomes increasingly important as we see other developing societies become more and more stable. South Korea, for example, used to be a U.S. aid recipient, but has now reached the status of a donor country. According to Secretary of State <b>John Kerry</b>, this shift in global responsibility will require more diplomacy and dialogue between the U.S. and foreign governments. International collaboration is becoming increasingly vital for markets as well. <a href=\"http://www.southerncompany.com/?gclid=Cj0KEQiAp4yjBRCE_enjmpug944BEiQATCpLvdzfE3tNbaYvlyS_5Iea2iG27wk4T2PtOc0BlspnKBUaAoMV8P8HAQ\" target=\"_blank\">Southern Company</a>’s CEO <b>Thomas Fanning</b> noted that 80% of the world’s purchasing power lies outside the U.S. For business owners and entrepreneurs, this means that considerations of scaling globally and engaging international markets should be factored into business models.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><b>Preparation.</b> </h4><p>Ebola requires readiness. Health infrastructures must be bolstered and strengthened to account for the possibility of outbreak, which is why President Obama commissioned a Global Health Security Council earlier this year. The theme of preparation is critical, and is especially applicable to preparing the next generation for our progressively technological society.  Code has become a modern-day language and the alphabet needs to be taught early, according to White House Chief Technology Officer <b>Megan Smith</b>, who claims that code should be taught to 2nd graders. <span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\">Secretary of Commerce </span><b>Penny Pritzker </b><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\">believes that the U.S. would be leading the world in 3D printing, internet design, and phototonics, underlining the importance of investing in innovation. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\">With over a third of the conference’s speakers holding “CEO” or “Co-Founder” positions (such as </span><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/\" target=\"_blank\">edX</a><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\">’s <b>Anant Agarwal</b>,</span><a href=\"http://www.etsy.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Etsy</a><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\">’s <b>Chad Dickerson</b>, and </span><a href=\"http://www.dekaresearch.com/index.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">DEKA</a><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;\">’s<b> Dean Kamen</b>), the notion became very clear that several groundbreaking advancements are on the horizon, and we need to get people involved and excited about the process.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Ideas Forum spanned diverse topics—everything from energy, to food, to political campaigns, to genomics, to defense, to sports. Without a doubt, though, Ebola held a special place in the conference, and for good reason. Not only did it speak to issues of science policy and health research, but it tied together other greater messages worthy of attention. </p><p>So instead of criticizing the “unnecessary hype,” let’s continue the conversation, think out loud, and share our ideas.</p>"}];
