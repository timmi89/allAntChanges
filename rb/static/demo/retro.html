I vowed to look in new places in 2014 for TV journalism I could confidently tell readers to trust.” “I found one today, but it’s not on TV. It’s online.” Read the whole thing.'>The best television journalism is now online</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://blog.retroreport.org/post/72881585175' title='If you think that stealing secret files to reveal rampant spying by the federal government on American citizens – their personal mail, phone calls and more – started with Edward Snowden, then get ready for another story.  Long before Al Qaeda, there was Viet Nam. And long before Snowden, there was the Media, PA Eight. Instead of a computer programmer, they were professors, grad students and a taxi driver. Instead of electronic files, paper files. Thousands of them stolen when they broke into the Media, PA FBI office. Right from the file cabinets! And when the Media 8 got their hands on the files, they did the same thing as Edward Snowden – sent them to a journalist for publishing and the world to see.  This all occurred back in 1971 and remained in the background because the thieves were never captured and never talked. Until now.  Bonnie Bertram is a producer at Retro Report, the non-profit news and documentary group that follows important news events after the headlines fade. Their new video is Stealing J. Edgar Hoover’s Secrets, based on the new book by Betty Medsger, “The Burglary.”  '>Retro Report’s Bonnie Bertram: “Stealing J. Edgar Hoover’s Secrets”</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://blog.retroreport.org/post/68977544794' title='Few words did more to raise fears of environmental disaster over a generation than “Love Canal.” The small neighborhood outside Niagara Falls became big news when toxic chemicals – buried three decades earlier – began oozing from the ground.  The script that played out – new at the time – today feels like a long-running play: Fears, confusion, denials, public demands – demands for information and safety that largely went unheard and unacted upon. Until, that is, compelled by one local woman who kept up the fight, the government not only helped the residents move out, but eventually set up the landmark Superfund legislation in 1980.  But instead of that being the end of the story, some 15 years later, spurred by refurbished homes at below market prices, people moved back to Love Canal. And now it turns out some of them might have gotten more than they bargained for.  Here to explain: JP Olsen, a producer at Retro Report, the non-profit news and documentary group that specializes in following important news events after the headlines faded. Their new video is “Love Canal: A Legacy of Doubt.”  '>Retro Report’s JP Olsen: “Love Canal: A Legacy of Doubt”</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://blog.retroreport.org/post/68263849174' title='From secret eavesdropping to surreptitious email gathering, we all have an increased sense of how far the government seems willing to go in the war on terrorism.  But as many of us recall, in those first days and years following 9/11, the fear and wonder of how far terrorists had infiltrated our cities and towns was real – how far had they gone to integrate themselves into our societies, waiting to strike unannounced? The concern was so-called Sleeper Cells, and when the FBI arrested three Arabs in Detroit just 6 days after 9/11 on false document charges, our worries were confirmed.  However, what if it turned out that these alleged terrorists weren’t terrorists at all? That this alleged sleeper cell was, in fact, just a dream? What if, as we debate today government’s reach and the tension between public safety and civil liberties, we had fair warning nearly a decade ago that terrible mistakes are extremely easy to make? What, if anything, have we learned?  Peter Klein is a Reporter and Director at Retro Report, the non-profit news and documentary group that follows important events after the headlines fade. Their new video is “The Sleeper Cell That Wasn’t.”  '>Retro Report’s Peter Klein: “The Sleeper Cell That Wasn’t”</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://blog.retroreport.org/post/68263754085' title='It was the day the lights went out across the East Coast of the U.S. and Canada. Just more than 10 years ago, August 2003, 50 million people from New York to Ottawa were left in the dark.  The first thought for many was terrorism. But then it became clear: This disaster was not the product of some terror network, but of our power network. It had overloaded and shut down.  This was the warning shot many in the power industry had predicted: An old infrastructure, lacking sufficient investment and modernization left millions without electricity. No lights. Elevators stuck. Subways shutdown. For some, no water or bathrooms in the dangerous heat of summer. If bad things happen in the dark, this was a nightmare.  Now, 10 years later, are better prepared? Have we made the investments needed to keep the lights on?

But in December, 1971, the hope for a cure couldn’t have been higher. President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act, launching America’s War on Cancer. With some reports predicting a cure by the bicentennial, the full power of the U.S. Government would go behind fighting this destructive disease.  Needless to say, more than 40 years later, cancer continues to ravage our society. Some 13 million people currently live with cancer in the U.S. About 1.6 million new cases are diagnosed yearly; and more than half a million Americans die of cancer each year.  And while, thankfully, great progress has been made – more people not just surviving, but beating cancer – we all know someone who has suffered.  In looking back, were hopes of a quick victory overplayed by politicians and the media? And whatever happened to the promises made in that historic bill signing four decades ago? Can victory ever be declared?  Jill Rosenbaum is a producer at Retro Report, the non-profit news and documentary group that follows important events after the headlines fade. Their new video is “The Long War on Cancer.”  '>Retro Report’s Jill Rosenbaum: “The Long War on Cancer”</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://blog.retroreport.org/post/64690657584' title='It was the poster child for a legal system gone haywire. In 1994, an Albuquerque, NM jury gave $2.9 million dollars to a local grandmother who spilled McDonald’s coffee in her lap.  Within days, the story went global: New York. Germany. France. And then, Capitol Hill, where it became a political centerpiece for Newt Gingrich’s Contract with America and the Common Sense Legal Reform Act.  But as this story grew, did it become more fiction than fact? What if this cause célèbre of a case got that way, because in the oversimplification of storytelling and lawmaking, people didn’t understand what really happened?  Retro Report’s Bonnie Bertram speaks to “Conversation with Thinkers&quot; about our new video is “Liebeck v. McDonald’s: The Big Burn.”  '>Bonnie Bertram on “Liebeck v. McDonald’s: The Big Burn”</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://blog.retroreport.org/post/64385237561' title='It was a scientific feat for the ages. A result so exciting and scary, that one reporter wondered , “Should we be applauding a mind-boggling scientific breakthrough or be nervous about where it might lead us?”  February 1997. Scientists in Scotland succeeded where no man had gone before. A mammal was cloned. Sheep number 6LL3. Her name was Dolly.  Dolly became an overnight sensation and fears of counting the same sheep over and over again – or, worse, the same cloned human being – took hold. But those concerns – some moral, and some the stuff of science fiction movies – soon got in the way of other promising science. Science that might have saved lives.  How did Dolly spin out of control? And to what extent did our fears at the time come true?

The Boston Bombing. Newtown, CT. Even the recent Navy Yard Shootings. Speculation on who did it. Speculation that often is spectacularly wrong.  But perhaps no whodunit speculation was more wrong that what occurred in 1996. The Atlanta Olympics, Centennial Olympic Park. A bomb goes off. One killed; more than 100 injured. But quickly – to nearly everyone’s relief – the FBI had a person of interest. Richard Jewell.  His face and name were everywhere. The media followed him from home to work and back again. According to widespread media reports, Jewell fit the profile of a potential terrorist. Many felt sure we had our man. Of course, it turned out Richard Jewell was missing one key quality: He wasn’t a terrorist. He didn’t commit the crime.  How did the media – and law enforcement – get the story so wrong?

          <h1 class="entry-title">Stealing J. Edgar Hoover&#8217;s Secrets</h1>
          
            
            <p>On March 8, 1971, a group of eight Vietnam War protestors broke into a Federal Bureau of Investigation field office in Media, Pennsylvania and stole hundreds of government documents that shocked a nation.</p>
<p>The stolen memos, reports and internal correspondence provided the first tangible evidence that J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI was systematically targeting and harassing hundreds of American citizens then known collectively as “the New Left.”</p>
<p>That discovery eventually led to Congressional investigations, more revelations of secret, illegal FBI actions, and sweeping reforms. But the burglars were never caught &#8212; despite a massive five-year investigation by the FBI &#8212; and their identities have remained secret – until now.</p>
<p>A new book by Betty Medsger, <a href="http://theburglary.com">The Burglary</a>, identifies the Media burglars for the first time. It also details the planning, execution, and consequences of the long-forgotten heist, which was carried out by a group that included college professors, graduate students, and a cab driver. Their story is also chronicled in a new documentary by Johanna Hamilton, <a href="http://www.1971film.com">1971</a>.</p>
