“If you ask 20 different readers why they read, they will all be right.”
Teresa Nielsen Hayden

Bonjourno.  This is a fake article written to give you, the undoubtedly splendid reader, some pleasant content for playing with the ReadrBoard widget.

<a href="http://readrboard.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/readrboard-widget.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-18" title="readrboard-widget" src="http://readrboard.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/readrboard-widget.png" alt="" width="400" /></a>Meet the Readrboard widget.  It's pretty friendly, really.  It stays out of your way for the most part, but as soon as you get the hankering to react, share, or discuss something particular on a webpage, it can probably help you.

See those pins on the page?  Hover over one, and you can see - in a word or two - what other folks are saying around here.  Just one click, and you’ll see even more reactions.

Anything in particular get your attention?  Hover over some images or select some text and let the other readers know about it.  After all, this is the new era of publishing and we readers are in it together.  Even if we've never met, we're in a community just because, in reading, we’ve digested the same content.  We think this is pretty fantastic.

Alright, for those of you who might be a little click-shy, here’s an easy one.  Here’s a picture of a cute charming puppy.  Admit it, you think it's cute, don’t you?  Or maybe you think it's preposterous, we don't know, tag it whatever you want.  


Now, see that pin when you hover over the image?  As you can see...  Fact. This puppy is adorable.

Okay, that was a warmup.  We know this has been pretty strenuous, so we'll give you a coffee break and a chance to watch this captivating film... coffee break... Okay, we’re back.  Wait, you already figured out that it’s the same as images?  

Not bad, young padawan.  Well here’s one final mission for you.  After you make one of your brilliant reactions, share it with a friend by clicking on one of the shiny twitter or facebook buttons.  Since you’ve come this far, I think you can figure it from there.

So it's pretty easy, right?  Well that's good, because we know it's hard out there for an earnest reader.  We know you’re hard at work adding a truly important perspective to online conversation.  We hate to see that voice get drowned out by spam and white noise.
We understand that online social tools have a lot of room for improvement.  That’s why we're excited to think hard about these issues and kick off some genuine innovations.  Of course, this is just a beta product and we know we can't go from 0-to-awesome just yet.  We're starting small, bringing you a simple tool that we hope nails-it on a couple of core ideas:

    Enable reactions on a more granular level
        React directly about that image or that quote. No need to requote, make copy pasta or attach that cat image to an email. Click, react, you’re done.
    Let readers see reactions in the context that people made them
        Just use share a link using Readrboard....  no need to send your friend a link along with some crazy instructions about the third paragraph on left past video about ukelelees. Just have them click our short url and the page scrolls like butter.



Ok, so thats what we’ve done so far. Stay tuned for more exciting ideas, and let us know how we're doing.  We mean it - we really want your criticism; please go ahead and mark up this page with reactions where you have opinions.  We're pretty excited about seeing where this thing can go and have some great advisers to help us along the way.
